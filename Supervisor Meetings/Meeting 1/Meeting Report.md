# Meeting Report

## 1st Supervisor Meeting

In this first meeting, we discussed my research area of interest. Dr Kahn provided insights into some of my ideas about blockchain interoperability and connecting to legacy systems. He offered some fascinating ideas, such as developing a system that allows for data interoperability between two organisations or legacy systems, such as using a blockchain to map data between two databases in a schemaless way that allows for interoperability. Dr Kahn provided examples of a supply chain where the supplier may need to share data with the shipping organisation and how this could be facilitated using a blockchain. Additionally, he also mentioned that interoperability between banking systems is an area of interest as well.

Furthermore, we discussed the research methodology and agreed that action research would be the appropriate methodology for this type of project. Dr Kahn made suggestions regarding the types of users and actors in the proposed system and indicated that it would be helpful to identify case organisations and potentially find users that would test the system and provide feedback. Dr Kahn has provided an additional reading that I will work through regarding action research in preparation for next week's meeting.

Finally, in preparation for the meeting next week, I will investigate these ideas further and provide a focused project outline that we can discuss. Furthermore, we will need to discuss the project proposal and ethical considerations documents that need to be submitted.

My proposed agenda topics for next week are:

- Project Outline
- Research Methodology
- Project Proposal
- Ethical Considerations
- Literature Review
