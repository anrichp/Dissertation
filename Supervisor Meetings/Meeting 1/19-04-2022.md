Proof of concepts connecting with companies house and land registry.
Integration with legacy systems - RDMS or Web (Ubiquitious).

### Integration with blockchain with legacy systems

- Take two legacy systems, then with proof of concepts A. integration of two types of systems.
- what sort of legacy system
  - supply chain
    - Producer
    - Shipment
  - Two datbases A and B, at present they dont talk to one another
  - Conneting these databases together via blockchain

### Action design research methodology

- Ideally you will need a user or an actor that you can receive feedback from when they engage with your application.
- Potentially finding supply chain organisations that I could contact and ask them to be a part of the system as actors.
- Using the concept of a restaurant or store could also be a sufficient example of supply chain.
- If an organisation is not possible, you could find friends and family that could be actors in the system.
- Design a technical framework that describes the interoperability between two systems.

#### UML Diagrans

- Data Flow
- Use Case

### Research gap

#### RDBMS

- Mapping between databases using a blockchain provides and interesting case for interoperability.
- You don't have to change the schema to interoperate between databases.

## Tools to explore

- CODA
- Substrate
- Ganash (IDE for building blockchains) - dummy blockchain frameworks

## Action Items

- Think about the domain
  - For example, two banks interoperating their data.
  - Two banks talking with each other
  - Transaction history between different actors.
  - There are different levels of security.
  - Blockchain can provide a smart contract. You can choose smart contract.
