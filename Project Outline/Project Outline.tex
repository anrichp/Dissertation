\section{Abstract}

\autocite{belchiorSurveyBlockchainInteroperability2021}
state that "blockchains of blockchains are frameworks that provide reusable data, network consensus, incentive, and contract layers for the creation of application-specific blockchains (customized blockchains) that interoperate between each other."
