# Project Outline Notes

## Research problem

### Guiding Questions

* What is the current situation?
* What is wrong with the situation?
* What are the most recent events that led us to the current situation?
* What is the setting of the problem.

### Context

What the current situation is and what needs to change.

### knowledge gap

Context and the Significance, you need to be well versed in the discourse of the literature.

### Significance of the problem

The scope of the problem.

## Research Question

### Initial broad questions

It is essential to develop a purpose statement, for example, "The purpose of this study is to investigate/determine/establish a relationship between..."

* Why are cross-chain protocols necessary for existing blockchains?
  * The purpose statement here would be: The purpose of this study is to investigate why cross-chain protocols are required in the world of blockchains.

## Topic Hunting

### FRIN (Further research is needed)

* Within most articles, there will be a discussion about further research towards the end.
* These will usually be entirely original
* These may not be areas that interest you.

### Assess an "old" topic within a new, unique context

* Take a body of theory that is well researched and assess whether it is relevant within a particular context, country, industry or demographic.
* For example, consumer trust has been researched extensively in a first-world context only.
* There needs to be a legitimate reason why the research is not valid in a particular area.

### Brainstorming and mind mapping

* Uncensored free thinking.
* If the other two methods don't work, you can think about some potential directions.
* Write down the ideas from that session, come up with a list of ideas, and see whether this has been covered in the research.
* Whatever ideas you come up with, you need to continually return to the literature to determine whether it's unique.

### Research Questions

#### Potential topic (Consumer trust in Robo-advisors within the UK)

#### Potential Research Questions

* What are the key drivers of UK consumer trust in robo-advisors?
* How do these drivers vary between demographic groups?

### Evaluating the topic ideas

Turn this into excel and score these.

* Originality - is it unique enough for your program?
* Importance - is it worth researching/answering?
* Literature base - is there enough literature to build on?
* Data access - can you get access to the data you need?
* Resources - will you have access to required resources?
* Data collection - are you able (and willing) to collect data?
* Analysis - will you be able to analyse the data correctly?
* Personal attraction - overall, how attracted are you?

#### Elevator pitch

All answers must be no more than one or two scentences.

* Come up with a pitch on each of your top three topics.
* WHAT - explain the big picture of your research.
* WHY IT'S ORIGINAL - explain how your topic is unique.
* WHY IT'S IMPORTANT - explain why this is valuable.
* HOW - explain how you will undertake the research. (Quantitative or Qualitative)
