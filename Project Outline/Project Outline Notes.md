## Research problem

### Guiding Questions

- What is the current situation?
- What is wrong with the situation?
- What are the most recent events that led us to the current situation?
- What is the setting of the problem.

### Context

What the current situation is and what needs to change.

### knowledge gap

Context and the Significance, you need to be well versed in the discourse of the literature.

### Significance of the problem

The scope of the problem.

## Research Question

### Initial broad questions

It is essential to develop a purpose statement, for example, "The purpose of this study is to investigate/determine/establish a relationship between..."

- Why are cross-chain protocols necessary for existing blockchains?
  - The purpose statement here would be: The purpose of this study is to investigate why cross-chain protocols are required in the world of blockchains.

## Topic Hunting

### FRIN (Further research is needed)

- Within most articles, there will be a discussion about further research towards the end.
- These will usually be entirely original
- These may not be areas that interest you.

### Assess an "old" topic within a new, unique context

- Take a body of theory that is well researched and assess whether it is relevant within a particular context, country, industry or demographic.
- For example, consumer trust has been researched extensively in a first-world context only.
- There needs to be a legitimate reason why the research is not valid in a particular area.

### Brainstorming and mind mapping

- Uncensored free thinking.
- If the other two methods don't work, you can think about some potential directions.
- Write down the ideas from that session, come up with a list of ideas, and see whether this has been covered in the research.
- Whatever ideas you come up with, you need to continually return to the literature to determine whether it's unique.

### Research Questions

#### Potential topic (Consumer trust in Robo-advisors within the UK)

#### Potential Research Questions

- What are the key drivers of UK consumer trust in robo-advisors?
- How do these drivers vary between demographic groups?

### Evaluating the topic ideas

Turn this into excel and score these.

- Originality - is it unique enough for your program?
- Importance - is it worth researching/answering?
- Literature base - is there enough literature to build on?
- Data access - can you get access to the data you need?
- Resources - will you have access to required resources?
- Data collection - are you able (and willing) to collect data?
- Analysis - will you be able to analyse the data correctly?
- Personal attraction - overall, how attracted are you?

#### Elevator pitch

All answers must be no more than one or two sentences.

- Come up with a pitch on each of your top three topics.
- WHAT - explain the big picture of your research.
- WHY IT'S ORIGINAL - explain how your topic is unique.
- WHY IT'S IMPORTANT - explain why this is valuable.
- HOW - explain how you will undertake the research. (Quantitative or Qualitative)

## Hunting for my topic

### Belchior, R. et al. (2021) ‘A Survey on Blockchain Interoperability: Past, Present, and Future Trends’, ACM Computing Surveys, 54(8), p. 168:1-168:41. doi:10.1145/3471140.

#### Research areas

##### Architecture for Blockchain Interoperability

- Define a blockchain interoperability maturity model, modeling interoperability at its various layers (eg. technological, semantic, organisational)
- Model the different views on the various types of interoperability, according to different stakeholders (eg. the providers technical view on cross-blockchain dApp vs the semantic view of the end-user on the same cross-blockchain dApp)
- Study blockchain interoperability semantics by exploring, for example, the research area of view integration.

##### Public Connectors

- Research on how permissioned blockchains can benefit from sidechains to improve scalability and privacy.
- Develop protocols to allow fiat money exchange, higher liquidity on decentralised exchanges. Conversely, improve the level of privacy and security of centralised exchanges.

##### Blockchain of blockchains

- Integration of existing blockchain systems with Blockchain of Blockchains.
- Study of Blockchain of Blockchains can provide a reliable interoperability scheme bridging permissioned blockchains and permissionless blockchains.
- Connect Blockchain of Blockchains to both centralised systems and decentralised ledger systems (eg. Polkadot to Visa)

##### Hybrid Connectors

- Decentralise trust of trusted relays by intergrating them with public blockchains (eg. by submitting the state periodically to a public blockchain)
- Study how blockchain-agnostic protocols can be easily adapeted to existing ledgers.
- Explore the blockchain of blockchains approach as an advance in dependable blockchain based applications.
- Improve atomicity and consistency guarantees on cross-blockchain decentralised applications.
- Explore blockchain migration across public and permissioned ledgers. Such migration schemes can be decentralised and adapt to functional and non-functional requirements imposed by stakeholders.
- Explore blockchain migration via non-trusted relays (eg. using a set of public escrow nodes following a protocol.)
- Develop frameworks for multiple blockchain management. Such frameworks should respond to multiple stakeholder needs, decentralising trust.
- Model integration abstraction layers that enable the development of universally connected contracts.
- Research on the visualisation of CC-Txs.

##### Supporting technologies and stadards, use cases, and others

- Research on blockchain interoperability programming languages, suppporting tools, and standards, including but not limited to cross-blockchain programming languages and frameworks, decentralised identifiers and verifiable credentials, and blickchain interoperability standards for enterprise blockchains.
- Explore new cases using multiple blockchains, the "value-level" interoperability.
- Research synergies between cryptocurrency-based interoperability approaches, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors.
- Study security aspects of blockchain interoperability.
- Understand the implications of the diferent interoperability layers (value, semantic, organisational, amoung others)

#### Topics that stand out to me from the list above

- Research on how permissioned blockchains can benefit from sidechains to improve scalability and privacy.
- Connect Blockchain of Blockchains to both centralised systems and decentralised ledger systems (eg. Polkadot to Visa)
- Research on the visualisation of CC-Txs.
- Study security aspects of blockchain interoperability.
- Understand the implications of the diferent interoperability layers (value, semantic, organisational, amoung others)

## Other Notes

### Substrate

- A template for creating other blockchains.
- Works both as a blockchain and it exists as a blockchain that exists under the polkadot umbrella (shard or para-chain)
