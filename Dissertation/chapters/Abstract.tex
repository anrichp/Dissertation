Blockchain technology has seen a phase of maturation over the past few years, where we have seen various use cases emerging in a variety of different industries.
Although blockchain technology has seen impressive adoption, some use cases have minimal exploration. This dissertation attempts to outline the development of a blockchain prototype for the banking industry as a decentralised record storage architecture facilitating the interoperability of the data across the organisation. This dissertation makes use of the Design Science Research methodology (DSR) to work alongside two departments from separate organisations to collect the requirements for the prototype system. The developed artefact attempts to answer the research question "How can blockchain technology facilitate data interoperability in a banking organisation?".
