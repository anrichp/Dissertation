\section{Defining Blockchain Technology}

\subsection{Background}

Blockchain technology reaches back far further than the inception of Bitcoin, and we can see some of the first implementations appearing in 1998.
In a 1998 white paper titled bmoney, we see some of the earliest building blocks of cryptocurrencies and the adoption of blockchain technologies \autocite{daiBmoney1998}.
Wei Dai outlines some cornerstone concepts that would later inspire Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Wei begins to outline a form of Zero Knowledge proof where two parties involved in an exchange or transaction use pseudonyms in the form of public keys to identify themselves within the context of a transaction \autocite{ZeroknowledgeProofsEthereum2022}. Furthermore, Wei beings laying the foundation of cryptographically complex puzzles that are solved to determine the value of the currency transferred. The concepts mentioned above would eventually lead to one of the crucial components of blockchains known as proof of work. \par
