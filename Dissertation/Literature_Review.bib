However, it has not yet been envisioned whether and which problems in Software Engineering (SE) Blockchain technology could solve. In this paper, we coin this field "Blockchain-based Software Engineering" and exemplify how Blockchain technology could solve two core SE problems: Continuous Integration (CI) Services such as Travis CI and Package Managers such as apt-get. We believe that Blockchain technology could help (1) democratize and professionalize Software Engineering infrastructure that currently relies on free work done by few volunteers, (2) improve the quality of artifacts and services, and (3) increase trust in ubiquitously used systems like GitHub or Travis CI.},

Blockchain technology (BT) promises benefits in trustability, collaboration, organization, identification, credibility, and transparency. In this paper, we conduct an analysis in which we show how open science can benefit from this technology and its properties. For this, we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystem and compared them with the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We also review literature and promising blockchain-based projects for open science to describe the current research situation. To this end, we examine the projects in particular for their relevance and contribution to open science and categorize them afterwards according to their primary purpose. Several of them already provide functionalities that can have a positive impact on current research workflows. So, BT offers promising possibilities for its use in science, but why is it then not used on a large-scale in that area? To answer this question, we point out various shortcomings, challenges, unanswered questions, and research potentials that we found in the literature and identified during our analysis. These topics shall serve as starting points for future research to foster the BT for open science and beyond, especially in the long-term.},

Numerous industry projects are developed and are under the development phase for enhancing blockchain technology in every way possible and making it applicable to various application-domains. Since the inception of Ethereum, many blockchain platforms have been developed using different types of technologies. Blockchain platforms, from its security perspective, don't interact with the outside world and acts as an independent and standalone ledger. But blockchain technology can not meet the needs of today's world if different ledgers don't interact with each other and with the legacy systems. Hence, Blockchain platforms should be able to communicate with each other and provide services to each other. Researchers and developers around the world are already working to achieve blockchain interoperability. In this paper, we survey interoperability solutions provided for blockchain platforms, both by industry people and the research community.},

These innovations have tackled technical challenges that were unresolved until their appearance. Existing models of peer-to-peer systems need a revision to cover the spectrum of potential systems that can be now implemented as peer-to-peer systems. This work presents a framework to build these systems. It uses an agent-oriented approach in an open environment where agents have only partial information of the system data. The proposal covers data access, data discovery and data trust in peer-to-peer systems where different actors may interact. Moreover, the framework proposes a distributed architecture for these open systems, and provides guidelines to decide in which cases Blockchain technology may be required, or when other technologies may be sufficient.},

  abstract = {Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of the Internet. However, the development of cross-blockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. With that regard, we propose an efficient, interoperable blockchain architecture, InterTrust, to support interoperability and trustworthiness among arbitrary blockchain systems (including homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains). It consists of an atomic cross-chain communication protocol, which can be considered an agnostic protocol to integrate existing blockchain systems smoothly. InterTrust is powered by two innovative techniques: threshold signature scheme and trusted hardware. The threshold signature scheme guarantees consistency and verifiability in the target blockchain systems, and the trusted hardware guarantees trusted services among distinct blockchain systems. Combining these two techniques provides an efficient cross-chain communication protocol to facilitate atomic swaps and interoperable operations between different blockchain systems. Our interoperable architecture is robust to support arbitrary blockchain systems. We also present the security analysis on the scenarios of integrating our protocol into Byzantine fault tolerance based blockchain systems.},

There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from diferent perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To ill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine speciies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems. CCS Concepts: · Information systems → Data management systems; Distributed storage.},

  abstract = {Supply chain finance (SCF), a proposal to address financing problems of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), aims to make working capital optimized by utilizing credit and transaction information through cooperation between upstream and downstream in the supply chain. But some demerits such as information asymmetry and the lack of trust in financing scenarios could still be witnessed in supply chain finance. Blockchain technology, with the characteristics of asymmetric encryption, decentralization, nonrepudiation, and conducting transactions without the supervision of a trusted third party, has revolved multiple stages of development. Smart contracts are regarded as an important derivative technology of blockchain, which are automatically executed by the code between multiple parties through the blockchain without relying on a trusted institution. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based supply chain financial system combining smart contracts and main methods of supply chain financing to solve the disadvantages of SCF. We select three represented financing modes to design financing platforms with the introduction of smart contracts, and present our schemes in the form of specific pseudo code. All financing processes of supply chain are conducted on the basis of ethereum blockchain. This allows SMEs which have difficulty in capital turnover in the short term, or have insufficient credit to get financial loans more easily compared with traditional financing approaches due to merits of blockchain, and also this could facilitate supply chain to improve financing efficiency for SMEs.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to clarify common misconceptions regarding the blockchain technology, and pointing out some worrisome practices in the field of blockchain technology. We first provide a brief introduction of the blockchain technology, highlighting its design principle, nuts and bolts, and the most fundamental innovation of the technology. Next, we elaborate on a key concept regarding data immutability. In particular, it is a mistake to equate blockchain to data immutability. Data immutability can only be achieved in large-scale public blockchains where the cost becomes an insurmountable barrier for any attempt to change the data recorded in the blockchain. The third topic we discuss is the differences between public, private, and consortium blockchains. We caution the use of private and consortium blockchains. The last topic we argue is regarding blockchain consensus. Because the proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm has obvious drawbacks on energy consumption, many alternative algorithms have been proposed. We single out two most egregious wrong practices: (1) selecting a small set of validators for reaching consensus, and (2) adopting traditional distributed consensus.},

  abstract = {Credit bank provides learning channels and direction for growing talents, but the current centralized management form of credit bank is not conducive to the management of learning results. The blockchain technology can solve the problem of credit management in credit bank system. The course, students and the results of their learning are linked to the block by the blockchain technology. It can realize the decentralization of management, the automation of transfer about learning credit and education, results are traceable and it cannot be tampered with, so blockchain technology can save management resources of credit bank and improve trust. It is feasible that using hyperledger fabric technology to realize the credit management of credit bank system by system design and experiment.},
