  abstract = {The adoption of permissioned blockchain networks in enterprise settings has seen an increase in growth over the past few years. While encouraging, this is leading to the emergence of new data, asset and process silos limiting the potential value these networks bring to the broader ecosystem. Mechanisms for enabling network interoperability help preserve the benefits of independent sovereign networks, while allowing for the transfer or sharing of data, assets and processes across network boundaries. However, a naive approach to interoperability based on traditional point-to-point integration is insufficient for preserving the underlying trust decentralized networks provide. In this paper, we lay the foundation for an approach to interoperability based on a communication protocol that derives trust from the underlying network consensus protocol. We present an architecture and a set of building blocks that can be adapted for use in a range of network implementations and demonstrate a proof-of-concept for trusted data-sharing between two independent trade finance and supply-chain networks, each running on Hyperledger Fabric. We show how existing blockchain deployments can be adapted for interoperation and discuss the security and extensibility of our architecture and mechanisms.},

Blockchain databases are an emerging and important class of blockchain technology that is critical to the development of non-trivial smart contracts, distributed applications and decentralized marketplaces. In this work, we consider the problem of designing end-to-end encrypted blockchain databases to support the development of decentralized applications that need to store and query sensitive data. In particular, we show how to design what we call blockchain encrypted multi-maps (EMM) which can be used to instantiate various kinds of NoSQL blockchain databases like key-value stores or document databases. We propose three blockchain EMM constructions, each of which achieves different tradeoffs between query, add and delete efficiency. All of our constructions are legacy-friendly in the sense that they can be implemented on top of any existing blockchain. This is particularly challenging since blockchains do not support data deletion. We implemented our schemes on the Algorand blockchain and evaluated their concrete efficiency empirically. Our experiments show that they are practical.},

Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a medical record that can be accessed and have certain limitations. The challenge in implementing MR is how to be able to collect, store, and analyze patient data in a comprehensive and integrated manner without having to violate patient privacy. The implementation of MR is how to transmit data between hospitals. To solve the problems and issues faced in implementing MR, there is a technology that can overcome this, one of which is using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that managed by many participants in an availability manner. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that anyone can use to create and deploy decentralized applications that run on the blockchain network. The data stored on the Ethereum blockchain will always be there and can be seen as long as the blockchain network is still online. With ethereum, the process of sharing data will be easy to do using a computer belonging to the hospital as a blockchain node. The result of implementing blockchain into medical record is now the data can be shared securely between hospitals.},

  abstract = {SQL Ledger is a new technology that allows cryptographically verifying the integrity of relational data stored in Azure SQL Database and SQL Server. This is achieved by maintaining all historical data in the database and persisting its cryptographic (SHA-256) digests in an immutable, tamper-evident ledger. Digests representing the overall state of the ledger can then be extracted and stored outside of the RDBMS to protect the data from any attacker or high privileged user, including DBAs, system and cloud administrators. The ledger and the historical data are managed transparently, offering protection without any application changes. Historical data is maintained in a relational form to support SQL queries for auditing, forensics and other purposes. SQL Ledger provides cryptographic data integrity guarantees while maintaining the power, flexibility and performance of a commercial RDBMS. In contrast to Blockchain solutions that aim for full integrity, SQL Ledger offers a form of integrity protection known as Forward Integrity. The proposed technology is significantly cheaper and more secure than traditional solutions that establish trust based on audits or mediators, but also has substantial advantages over Blockchain solutions that are complex to deploy, lack data management capabilities and suffer in terms of performance due to their decentralized nature.},

But, Blockchain is a secure system where the transactional history regarding crypto-currency cannot be modified or destructed. Since 2008, Blockchain has gained immense interest due to exclusion of third-party organization participation in monitoring of the transactions. Ethereum is a protocol which is based on Blockchain technology and has several benefits over other crypto-currency based system and is best suited for creating a secure lending system. Every Ethereum based system runs on ‘Smart-Contracts’ which are lines of code and makes the system automated. As the system gets automated, proper algorithms can make the system reliable and secure as each and every step of the system is maintained and executed by the algorithm inside the Smart-Contracts. Blockchain systems work with peer-to-peer networks and also uses a consensus algorithm that’s why there is no possibility of data modification.},

  abstract = {Blockchain has emerged as a key technology for ensuring reliability and security in several application areas primarily including the healthcare sector. Blockchain is a distributed ledger where blocks of transactions are connected in a chain using the cryptographic hash function of the previous block, making it an append-only structure. Any modification on any of the blocks will generate different hash values in other blocks in a cascading manner and different link relations. In this way the blockchain achieves immutability and security. Blockchain also involves consensus mechanisms in order to ensure synchronization among blocks and agreement between existing nodes to add a new transaction in the chain. Healthcare data is highly sensitive in nature, which consists of private information related to the diagnosis and treatment of patients. In traditional approach these data are stored by each hospital separately where sharing data is very time consuming. Also, health data is very limited to access due to the risk of disclosure of sensitive information. In order to address these issues, the objective of this paper is to integrate blockchain technology with healthcare records/data in order to provide better sharing of data without the fear of data tampering or security breach.},

Most of these statements given to the citizens are in pdf format, and lately several banks offer statements in excel formats. Very rarely one can find XML types of statements, which can be further processed. To use data from statements in other applications, one has to build their own interpreter of bank statements. To solve the existing problem with interoperability, as a main motivation for this paper, we introduce an adapter, which can read various types of statements and return an XML file as output. Our realization of the adapter works with statements offered by most of the banks in our country as a proof of concept. The adapter was efficiently used in a special program for analysis of consumer costs, where one can access accounts in several banks and calculate taxes, income statements and analyze the costs.},

The blockchain technology can optimize the global financial infrastructure, achieving sustainable development, using more efficient systems than at present. In fact, many banks are currently focusing on blockchain technology to promote economic growth and accelerate the development of green technologies. In order to understand the potential of blockchain technology to support the financial system, we studied the actual performance of the Bitcoin system, also highlighting its major limitations, such as the significant energy consumption due to the high computing power required, and the high cost of hardware. We estimated the electrical power and the hash rate of the Bitcoin network, over time, and, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the Bitcoin system in its actual operation, we defined three quantities: “economic efficiency”, “operational efficiency”, and “efficient service”. The obtained results show that by overcoming the disadvantages of the Bitcoin system, and therefore of blockchain technology, we could be able to handle financial processes in a more efficient way than under the current system.},

In particular, the financial services industry has sought to capitalize on the underlying technology, known as distributed ledger technology, to generate new products, services, and innovative business models. In this article, through an in-depth investigation of the technology innovation evaluation process, we utilize a grounded theory approach to study 12 financial service organizations. This article is unique in that it explores the technology evaluation process concurrently as decision makers reacted to the potential uses, as opposed to a retrospective view after a technology innovation had been adopted. Evidence suggests that, organizations applied a specific process to determine the value of blockchain that consisted of understand, organize, and test, which collectively helped create the proof-of-value model. Surprisingly, we find that financial service organizations tend to view blockchain innovation as a lower priority due to the lack of a clear path to value. Additionally, financial service organizations consistently leverage industry consortiums to link to external knowledge and help with the decision-making process. Our findings have direct implications to both innovation researchers as well as practitioners seeking to evaluate blockchain technology.},

Advances in trending technologies have contributed to their adaptation in every part of human’s daily routine. Almost all healthcare-associated domains are now adapting to eHealth. Health professionals have been able to collect medical records, exchange medical data through a network of professionals and patients, provide healthcare through digital media, and track various health-related events, diseases, and disease outbreaks through a range of technologies, such as social media sites, applications, smartphones, and smart objects. This has resulted in an ample amount of knowledge related to patients that is created and needs to be handled effectively for better results. Although big data is the obvious option to handle this vast data collection, data protection and security for public health data is a prime concern. A blockchain is known as a record database located in a distributed personal computer network called nodes. In particular, it is a mutual, permanent record of peer-to-peer transactions constructed from linked blocks of transactions and stored in a digital ledger. No single person owns it, i.e., it is decentralized. The healthcare sector is one of the sectors looking to embrace the blockchain. This chapter aims to reflect the numerous facts leading to the introduction of blockchain technology in general and electronic medical record management of healthcare in particular. The chapter will study the various blockchain implementation frameworks.},

For example, M-Pesa provides distributed banking service in the developing regions so that the people without a bank account can deposit, withdraw, or transfer money. The current distributed banking systems lack the transparency in monitoring and tracking of distributed banking transactions and thus do not support auditing of distributed banking transactions for accountability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain-based distributed banking (BDB) scheme, which uses blockchain technology to leverage its built-in properties to record and track immutable transactions. BDB supports distributed financial transaction processing but is significantly different from cryptocurrencies in its design properties, simplicity, and computational efficiency. We implement a prototype of BDB using smart contract and conduct experiments to show BDB’s effectiveness and performance. We further compare our prototype with the Ethereum cryptocurrency to highlight the fundamental differences and demonstrate the BDB’s superior computational efficiency.},

RPOW uses hashcash, which are values whose SHA-1 hashes have many high bits of zeros. Normally POW tokens can't be reused because that would allow them to be double-spent. But RPOW allows for a limited form of reuse: sequential reuse. This lets a POW token be used once, then exchanged for a new one, which can again be used once, then once more exchanged, etc. This approach makes POW tokens more practical for many purposes and allows the effective cost of a POW token to be raised while still allowing systems to use them effectively.},

This qualitative study has analysed state-of-the-art blockchain research and technology in the banking and finance sector. Firstly, we selected and reviewed 76 literature in the banking and finance sector from 2016 to 2020 and provided a critical bibliometric review of existing literature. Secondly, we applied the well-known thematic analysis methodology to systematically identify the hot research topics, five potential business benefits and three types of potential challenges of applying blockchain technology to the banking and finance sector. Finally, we concluded by summarising the limitations of our study and subsequently highlighted future research directions. Despite several studies in other fields, no systematic review has thus far synthesised the research on blockchain application in this field to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Hence, the current study provides a starting point for future research and facilitates the work of both academic scholars and industry practitioners.},

  abstract = {Interoperability in healthcare has traditionally been focused around data exchange between business entities, for example, different hospital systems. However, there has been a recent push towards patient-driven interoperability, in which health data exchange is patient-mediated and patient-driven. Patient-centered interoperability, however, brings with it new challenges and requirements around security and privacy, technology, incentives, and governance that must be addressed for this type of data sharing to succeed at scale. In this paper, we look at how blockchain technology might facilitate this transition through five mechanisms: (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation, (3) data liquidity, (4) patient identity, and (5) data immutability. We then look at barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability, specifically clinical data transaction volume, privacy and security, patient engagement, and incentives. We conclude by noting that while patient-driving interoperability is an exciting trend in healthcare, given these challenges, it remains to be seen whether blockchain can facilitate the transition from institution-centric to patient-centric data sharing.},

On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of “multi-center, weakly intermediated” scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a “regulatory sandbox” and the development of industry standards.},

With a theoretical lens based on institutional theory from the political science field, the analysis shows that interoperability is not just a technical issue and that economic and political factors are just as important when implementing enterprise architecture programs in government. The findings suggest that implementing enterprise architectures in government challenge the way information systems are organized and governed in public agencies and calls for a broader definition of interoperability. The case study indicates that interoperability challenges arise because there is no overall coordination of different information systems initiatives in the health sector and because public hospitals have no economic and/or immediate political incentives to share data and business functionality with other organizations.},

Failures of interoperability can lead to adverse events such as medical or communication errors at the clinical level or inefficient use of services at the organizational or regional level. However interoperability is a multi-faceted concept that must take place at the clinical, organizational and regional levels. Thus we need to look at healthcare interoperability from an overall system perspective. Various eHealth technologies provide the tools to facilitate integration but those tools must be used within a framework that integrates all users of the system across the various levels. This paper presents an eBusiness based framework for eHealth interoperability that maps specific processes and tools and applications to the multiple levels of the healthcare system. The framework can help us focus research and system development efforts to enable eHealth integration.},

However, it might be of interest to make two different blockchains interoperable, i.e., to allow one to transmit information from one blockchain to another blockchain. In this paper, we give a formalisation of this problem, and we prove that blockchain interoperability is impossible according to the classical definition of a blockchain. Under a weaker definition of blockchain, we demonstrate that two blockchains are interoperable is equivalent to creating a ‘2-in-1’ blockchain containing both ledgers, thus limiting the theoretical interest of making interoperable blockchains in the first place. We also observe that all practical existing interoperable blockchain frameworks work indeed by exchanging already created tokens between two blockchains and not by offering the possibility to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another one, which implies a modification of the balance of total created tokens on both blockchains. It confirms that having interoperability is only possible by creating a ‘2-in-1’ blockchain containing both ledgers.},

For this, we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystem and compared them with the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We also review literature and promising blockchain-based projects for open science to describe the current research situation. To this end, we examine the projects in particular for their relevance and contribution to open science and categorize them afterwards according to their primary purpose. Several of them already provide functionalities that can have a positive impact on current research workflows. So, BT offers promising possibilities for its use in science, but why is it then not used on a large-scale in that area? To answer this question, we point out various shortcomings, challenges, unanswered questions, and research potentials that we found in the literature and identified during our analysis. These topics shall serve as starting points for future research to foster the BT for open science and beyond, especially in the long-term.},

  abstract = {Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and other medical data contain important and sensitive privacy information of patients, which provide important basis and reference for their doctors to diagnose and treat them. With the continuous development of data sharing, big data applications and other technologies, new requirements are proposed for the storage of medical privacy data. At present, medical data have the characteristics of obstructed sharing and exchange, difficult data tracing and data sensitivity, which increases the cost and difficulty of each diagnosis. Moreover, patients lack the right to know and control their own medical data, which is easy to cause data fraud or data leakage. As a decentralized, tamper proof and traceable distributed ledger system, blockchain brings new solutions to these problems. This paper designs a medical data fusion and distributed privacy management system based on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain development platform and InterPlanetary File System. It can not only solve the problem of mutual distrust in the traditional system, but also realize the safe data storage and the safe sharing of medical record data between medical organizations which is a beneficial attempt to overcome the disadvantages of traditional hospital data separation. At the same time, according to the requirements of different levels and types of medical users or groups for data security and personal privacy protection, the access control technology of users is studied to ensure personal privacy data.},

  abstract = {Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption. Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchange between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchange. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in about 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiment results show that HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications},

  abstract = {Currently, Smart Cities use computational solutions that promote services to improve the quality of life of the entire population. However, these systems are often heterogeneous and designed in an isolated way that makes it challenging to integrate with each other. One of the ways to integrate systems that provide interoperability is the System-of-system concept. Communication among systems depends on mutual agreements made by intermediaries. It increases the cost, constrains collaboration, and distrusts shared data and services. Blockchain can fulfill these gaps and be a trusted decentralized controller entity based on a consensus mechanism among network participants. This Early-stage paper presents an initial doctoral research proposal on how to combine Blockchain with Systems-of-Systems concepts to provide trusted interoperability between Smart Cities systems.},

  abstract = {Blockchain is a technology for decentralized transactions that has been widely used with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Many studies have been conducted in the last decades, approaching cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology, more strongly in the context of financial transactions. However, little has been done to provide a panoramic view of the current literature; as a consequence, a careful understanding of the state-of-the-art papers remains limited and inconclusive. This study, therefore, aims to classify and provide a thematic analysis of studies on the use of blockchain in the context of financial area, thus allowing to create a clear systematic map of the current literature, and identify challenges and research opportunities. To achieve these objectives a systematic mapping study (SMS) approach was performed to answer 6 research questions. In total, 1884 studies were reviewed from 6 data sources, being 23 studies selected after a careful filtering process. The main findings were: (1) Over 65\% of the selected studies concentrated on adopting two blockchain platforms named Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum; (2) Over 60\% used blockchain technology to increase security; (3) Most studies did not reveal the consensus algorithm used; (4) Fintech (or Bank) and loan were the most explored application areas; (5) Over 60\% focused on producing prototype rather than frameworks; and (6) most studies were published in conferences. This study can benefit research community by generating a map of the literature, serving as a starting point for future researches. Moreover, this study reports some challenges worth investigating.},

  abstract = {The achievement of interoperability between public administrations across Europe is considered to be a crucial factor for the delivery of efficient, cost-effective and transparent public services. There are still many challenges and limitations to be faced, due to technical, semantic, legal and organizational factors. The importance of organizational interoperability towards information integration has been known for years. Nowadays, it still remains an enduring challenge and undoubtedly gains momentum due to the complexity of organizational aspect as the public organizations move toward inter-organizational governance as well as due to the enforcement of new policies such as Once Only principle and Open data. This paper initially highlights the importance of organizational interoperability in e-Government and the need to define metrics in order to assess the degree of organizational interoperability. A brief literature review on existing assessment tools, frameworks and models is presented. The development of a new model and tool for the assessment of organizational interoperability maturity of a digital public service, based on a referential model along with conceptual attributes, is thoroughly presented. The new approach can be used as an independent assessment model/tool in the area of organizational interoperability, while it could furthermore extend the IMAPS tool.},

Numerous industry projects are developed and are under the development phase for enhancing blockchain technology in every way possible and making it applicable to various application-domains. Since the inception of Ethereum, many blockchain platforms have been developed using different types of technologies. Blockchain platforms, from its security perspective, don't interact with the outside world and acts as an independent and standalone ledger. But blockchain technology can not meet the needs of today's world if different ledgers don't interact with each other and with the legacy systems. Hence, Blockchain platforms should be able to communicate with each other and provide services to each other. Researchers and developers around the world are already working to achieve blockchain interoperability. In this paper, we survey interoperability solutions provided for blockchain platforms, both by industry people and the research community.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we design and implement the first-ever decentralized replicated relational database with blockchain properties that we term blockchain relational database. We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.},

The study uses PRISMA-guided systematic review along with bibliometric analysis to achieve the purpose. Findings This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring and analyzing systematic studies available on blockchain with special reference to financial services sector. With blockchain based on five principles, namely, computational logic, peer-to-peer transmission, irreversibility of records, distributed database and transparency with pseudonym has immense potential to unleash and transform the financial service industry. With increasing blockchain-based operations of decentralized banking, insurance, trade finance, financial markets and cryptocurrency market, the subject is rapidly growing and seeking considerable contribution from scholars from around the world. Research limitations/implications This study uses systematic literature review approach, which has its own demerits. Like other studies based on Systematic Literature Review, this study also suffers from a certain bias such as sample selection bias, publication bias, data interpretation and the combination of quantitative and qualitative studies in the population. Further, the adoption and resultant benefits of blockchain have not been empirically tested.

But although blockchain is often seen as a strategic technology, research focusing on its impact on business models is still rare. This research derives a hypotheses model that connects IT innovations with the three generic value disciplines of banks “operational excellence”, “customer intimacy” and “product leadership” as well as the four generic elements of business models “what”, “who”, “how” and “value”. A business model acts as a mediator for IT innovation. To test the hypothesis model data provided from an international survey of 104 financial services institutions and start-up companies was applied. The results support the hypothesis that all three value disciplines might be impacted by blockchain technology in the future. The regression analysis reveals that especially banks’ operations could be significantly changed. With these results, this research contributes to the emerging literature on blockchain and business models and the strategic use of IT.},

  abstract = {In this study, a higher level of security was implemented by using InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) based peer-to-peer data storage on an Ethereum blockchain. IPFS is used as an image data storage medium that generates an IPFS hash, or known as content identifier (CID). The CID is used to access image data on the IPFS, which can be done with the help of an IPFS gateway. The CID is sent into the blockchain using a smart contract. The results of the study demonstrates that the use of IPFS as additional security on a blockchain system can be done. The size of file sent using IPFS proportionally affects the time it takes for IPFS to store the file. The larger the file size, the more time it will take. For each additional 1 MB file, there is an approximately 5\% increase in access time. The distance from the IPFS gateway will also affect file access times in which, the farther the IPFS gateway, the more time it takes. If the IPFS gateway is at a distance of 1,000 km, there will be a decrease in access time of about 5\%. The distance between the IPFS gateway and the accessor also affects success with accessing data. For the most distant gateway, i.e. the United States, there was even an access failure of 24\%.},

  abstract = {Today, the majority of banks offer many different online services to their customers and our study case will focus specifically on domestic and international banking transactions. By doing these services, these banks use enough time to conduct bank transactions from one bank account to another, some of which take more than a week, under a security that does not fully respect the privacy of operators and under the mercy of certain third party's services. Unfortunately, these banks face the limitations of payment systems (such as SWIFT, SEPA, and union pay) for international transactions and other banking exchange services. To remedy these problems of third-party trust, exaggerated latency, payment of high transaction fees, problems of theft and falsification of banking information, we will set up a storage and bank exchange platform, based on a private and confidential blockchain. In this platform, a number of authorized users will be able to hold and operate the nodes that will support the network. Nowhere in the world is there a system that directly connects banks, currencies and financial institutions without a trusted third party. In our case, these sworn users are banks. This platform will eliminate the presence of the trusted third party which is the third entity through which the various transactions and banking information must pass. To begin with, our platform will eliminate third-party trust, promote user-user transactions and then store bank transaction information in the blockchain. Our blockchain platform will allow users to make secure and confidential transactions at a lower cost and without a foreign exchange ban due to a maximum amount not to exceed as with the case of banks.},

Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have been proposed as a trust and efficiency mechanism for several inter organisation collaborative tasks. They can reduce friction in operations and help achieve a more streamlined and unified public service infrastructure. However, most of the work are either based on theory or purely conceptual and lack implementation.

This chapter delves into the opportunities in the banking sector to be explored and challenges to be met in the BCT-IoT implementation process. BCT- and IoT-based opportunities such as peer-to-peer lending, Know Your Customer (KYC) updation, Cross-border transfer payments, syndicate lendingSyndicate lending, fraudFraud reduction are some of the banking operations that are elaborated. To strengthen the banking network, the consensus algorithm of BlockchainBlockchain~network is much required and the use of IoT devices to act as nodes is pertinent.

Existing models of peer-to-peer systems need a revision to cover the spectrum of potential systems that can be now implemented as peer-to-peer systems. This work presents a framework to build these systems. It uses an agent-oriented approach in an open environment where agents have only partial information of the system data. The proposal covers data access, data discovery and data trust in peer-to-peer systems where different actors may interact. Moreover, the framework proposes a distributed architecture for these open systems, and provides guidelines to decide in which cases Blockchain technology may be required, or when other technologies may be sufficient.},

The interoperability among blockchains will revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of the Internet. However, the development of cross-blockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. With that regard, we propose an efficient, interoperable blockchain architecture, InterTrust, to support interoperability and trustworthiness among arbitrary blockchain systems (including homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains). It consists of an atomic cross-chain communication protocol, which can be considered an agnostic protocol to integrate existing blockchain systems smoothly. InterTrust is powered by two innovative techniques: threshold signature scheme and trusted hardware. The threshold signature scheme guarantees consistency and verifiability in the target blockchain systems, and the trusted hardware guarantees trusted services among distinct blockchain systems. Combining these two techniques provides an efficient cross-chain communication protocol to facilitate atomic swaps and interoperable operations between different blockchain systems. Our interoperable architecture is robust to support arbitrary blockchain systems. We also present the security analysis on the scenarios of integrating our protocol into Byzantine fault tolerance based blockchain systems.},

Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will definitely revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of Internet. The development of crossblockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. The way to effectively enable interoperability across multiple blockchains is thus essential and expecting to confront various unprecedented challenges. For instance, due to different transaction structures, ensuring the properties of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) in transactions processing and verification processes across diverse blockchain systems remains a challenging task in both academia and industry. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the current progress of blockchain interoperability. We explore both general principles and practical schemes to achieve interoperable blockchain systems. We then survey and compare the state-of-the-art solutions to deal with the interoperability of blockchains in detail. Finally, we discuss several critical challenges and some potential research directions to advance the research on exploring blockchain interoperability.},

Blockchain has decentralized mechanisms with persistency and auditability and runs as an immutable distributed ledger, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from diferent perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To ill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine speciies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems. CCS Concepts: · Information systems → Data management systems; Distributed storage.},

It has rushed into all walks of life with the power of breaking a bamboo, and is shining around the world. According to the basic functions of blockchain technology (BT), such as information tampering. Information transparency has certain security guarantees. This kind of security guarantee can ensure the reliability of the financial information system to a large extent and reduce financial fraud. The aim of this article is to study the application of regional chain technology in the financial field (FF). This article is based on the primary principles of blockchain, information asymmetry theory and moral theory. Through questionnaire surveys, corporate financial personnel, middle and high-level managers and other authorities, university researchers, scholars and other personnel with experience in the implementation and application of financial informationization in various industries to ensure the right and precise results of this survey with authority and credibility. It is helpful to improve the quality problems in the financial information processing process, and helps the company implement effective real-time and automatic control. Experimental investigations and studies have shown, Financial information quality issues have the highest score at 4.39 points, while management and control issues and security issues have scores of 4.26 and 4.22 points, respectively. That there is no doubt that the blockchain financial system(FS) has many advantages, but because the BT is still in its infancy, the research time is relatively short, and there are many unresolved and unidentified problems and deficiencies.},

We first provide a brief introduction of the blockchain technology, highlighting its design principle, nuts and bolts, and the most fundamental innovation of the technology. Next, we elaborate on a key concept regarding data immutability. In particular, it is a mistake to equate blockchain to data immutability. Data immutability can only be achieved in large-scale public blockchains where the cost becomes an insurmountable barrier for any attempt to change the data recorded in the blockchain. The third topic we discuss is the differences between public, private, and consortium blockchains. We caution the use of private and consortium blockchains. The last topic we argue is regarding blockchain consensus. Because the proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm has obvious drawbacks on energy consumption, many alternative algorithms have been proposed. We single out two most egregious wrong practices: (1) selecting a small set of validators for reaching consensus, and (2) adopting traditional distributed consensus.},
