  abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to the current state of art of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies. Blockchain is a fast-disruptive technology becoming a key instrument in share economy. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract aim to automatically and securely execute the needed responsibilities of a contract without the support of a centralized execution authority. The Smart Contract runs on top of the Blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between un-trusted parties without the interfere of third party to trust it as this Smart Contract is an executable code that runs with rules on the Blockchain. Smart Contracts have some features that serve the goals of social justice and fairness. The paper presents the basic important information about the structures of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies and conduct a comparison between the different methodologies used in the Smart Contracts. The issues faced within the Smart Contract technology are surveyed. The four key issues are identified as: codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. We survey case cases of usage of the Blockchain in various business sectors like real estate, voting system and supply chain. The paper aims to assist a developer to grasp the big picture of the Blockchain technology and to further assist in the decision process of suitability of the technology to a specific application area.},

  abstract = {The adoption of permissioned blockchain networks in enterprise settings has seen an increase in growth over the past few years. While encouraging, this is leading to the emergence of new data, asset and process silos limiting the potential value these networks bring to the broader ecosystem. Mechanisms for enabling network interoperability help preserve the benefits of independent sovereign networks, while allowing for the transfer or sharing of data, assets and processes across network boundaries. However, a naive approach to interoperability based on traditional point-to-point integration is insufficient for preserving the underlying trust decentralized networks provide. In this paper, we lay the foundation for an approach to interoperability based on a communication protocol that derives trust from the underlying network consensus protocol. We present an architecture and a set of building blocks that can be adapted for use in a range of network implementations and demonstrate a proof-of-concept for trusted data-sharing between two independent trade finance and supply-chain networks, each running on Hyperledger Fabric. We show how existing blockchain deployments can be adapted for interoperation and discuss the security and extensibility of our architecture and mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Blockchain interoperability is emerging as one of the crucial features of blockchain technology, but the knowledge necessary for achieving it is fragmented. This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain’s novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.},

  abstract = {With the innovation of distributed ledger technology (DLT), often known as blockchain technology, there has been significant growth of digital tokens in the form of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies. As the number of DLT networks increases, each with varying design characteristics, the likelihood that transacting parties are on the same network decreases. Thus, it is crucial to facilitate payments that are universal across networks, scalable to massive loads, and highly available. We envision a future payment network that may be built on top of DLT networks without being subject to their limitations on interoperability, scalability, and availability faced by DLT payment solutions today. Specifically, we propose a hub-and-spoke payment route, referred to here as Universal Payment Channels (UPC), that can be used to support digital token transfers of funds across different networks through payment channels. We further discuss the potential use cases of the UPC technology to support, and not complicate, an already robust digital payment ecosystem. Finally, through the paper, we share some future directions of the UPC technology.},

  abstract = {In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto released a White Paper introducing the cryptocurrency ‘bitcoin’ to the public. Intended to revolutionise the payments process, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (and therefore distributed) ‘electronic cash system’ that facilitates relatively fast online payments with low transaction costs and ‘without going through a financial institution’. As a currency, it is perhaps not surprising that bitcoin has been met with both scepticism from the public and resistance from traditional financial institutions. In contrast, as a platform, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) that underpins bitcoin (known as the blockchain) is now witnessing mainstream adoption by major financial institutions. This transition comes as banks and other financial institutions are recognising the blockchain’s significant potential to ‘radically transform’ the financial services industry, resulting in what some are calling the ‘fourth industrial revolution’. As a consequence, it is becoming increasingly clear that DLTs have the potential to similarly disrupt the shadow banking sector as they enable innovative business models to be adopted by both banks (acting outside of the traditional regulated realm) and non-bank institutions (to conduct financial services activities).},

One major difference are the performance and scalability factors which will be discussed and analytically investigated in this paper. In doing so, we provide guidance for defining a research agenda focusing on the investigation of the crucial role of scalability for blockchain systems. System performance -- measured in terms of (1) consensus response time (blockchain network latency or time to convergence/agreement); (2) number of transactions per second or throughput, and (3) computing (and power) resources consumed -- can be understood by considering the design dimensions of a blockchain system, namely: (i) the type of blockchain system needed from a requirements perspective which in turn determines; (ii) the complexity of the consensus protocol used; (iii) the topography of the traffic flow on the network; (iv) the performance and complexity of the domain-specific language that implements smart contracts; and (v) by the anticipated growth in size and complexity of the distributed ledger itself.},

In this paper, we conduct a Systematic Review of Literature in order to explore the current challenges of blockchains while presenting possible solutions to each of these challenges. We conclude that current challenges can be summarized in three categories: Scalability issues, security issues and a choice of the consensus protocol. We also briefly discuss the use of blockchain in current systems, concluding that while blockchains current immaturity makes it hard to recommend for most projects, blockchains in their current state could be used in the Internet of Things.},

  abstract = {With the increasing adoption of private blockchain platforms, consortia operating in various sectors such as trade, finance, logistics, etc., are becoming common. Despite having the benefits of a completely decentralized architecture which supports transparency and distributed control, existing private blockchains limit the data, assets, and processes within its closed boundary, which restricts secure and verifiable service provisioning to the end-consumers. Thus, platforms such as e-commerce with multiple sellers or cloud federation with a collection of cloud service providers cannot be decentralized with the existing blockchain platforms. This paper proposes a decentralized gateway architecture interfacing private blockchain with end-users by leveraging the unique combination of public and private blockchain platforms through interoperation. Through the use case of decentralized cloud federations, we have demonstrated the viability of the solution. Our testbed implementation with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, with three service providers, shows that such consortium can operate within an acceptable response latency while scaling up to 64 parallel requests per second for cloud infrastructure provisioning. Further analysis over the Mininet emulation platform indicates that the platform can scale well with minimal impact over the latency as the number of participating service providers increases.},

Several challenges in blockchain technology remain to be addressed, including the interoperability, survivability, and manageability of blockchain systems. Crucial to answering these challenges is the need to understand aspects of the Internet architecture that has made it scalable, resilient, and a commercial success as a global connectivity infrastructure. In this paper, we discuss a design philosophy for interoperable blockchain systems, using the design philosophy of the Internet architecture as the basis to identify key design principles. We recast some of the challenges faced in the design of the Internet architecture to that of the design of an interoperable blockchain architecture. We emphasize interoperability as a crucial requirement for the survivability and manageability of blockchain systems. The goal is to define an interoperable blockchain architecture, in which common components of the blockchain architecture can begin to be standardized, leading to lowering of development costs, better reusability, and higher degree of interoperability.},

  abstract = {Existing security mechanisms for managing the Internet infrastructural resources like IP addresses, AS numbers, BGP advertisements and DNS mappings rely on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that can be potentially compromised by state actors and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Ideally the Internet infrastructure needs a distributed and tamper-resistant resource management framework which cannot be subverted by any single entity. A secure, distributed ledger enables such a mechanism and the blockchain is the best known example of distributed ledgers. In this paper, we propose the use of a blockchain based mechanism to secure the Internet BGP and DNS infrastructure. While the blockchain has scaling issues to be overcome, the key advantages of such an approach include the elimination of any PKI-like root of trust, a verifiable and distributed transaction history log, multi-signature based authorizations for enhanced security, easy extensibility and scriptable programmability to secure new types of Internet resources and potential for a built in cryptocurrency. A tamper resistant DNS infrastructure also ensures that it is not possible for the application level PKI to spoof HTTPS traffic.},

Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines.

Some target a particular niche market such as supply chain and financial services, while others strive to differentiate themselves from the increasingly saturated market by offering new functionality. This dynamic and constantly changing blockchain ecosystem makes it very challenging to keep abreast of all the latest breakthroughs and research. It is evident that there is also a growing desire to collaborate with others developing blockchain solutions, which brings new impetus to blockchain interoperability research. We review the strategies that some key players in the blockchain ecosystem have implemented, or are proposing to develop, to satisfy this increasing demand for cross-chain communication and transactions between sidechains. Interoperability presents a complex and challenging stumbling block to the wider uptake of blockchain technology. We find that although there is a plethora of blockchains and interoperability implementations, or proposals, at a higher level of abstraction there is only a handful of approaches. However, the way they are implemented can differ quite substantially. We present a summary of the reviews we conducted in a table for ease of comparing and contrasting.},

  abstract = {The slower than expected adoption rate of blockchain technology has highlighted that there are barriers due to the diversity of its applications and its users. To overcome this limitation and take full advantage of the novel technology, researchers from academia as well as industry are dedicated to find different solutions, where two or more blockchains can interact with each other. As a result, several interoperability solutions have presented themselves. To investigate the functionalities and underlying mechanisms of interoperable blockchain solutions, researchers have conducted several surveys by discussing the features and innovations of these methods. However, the existing surveys tend to focus on the architectural description of the interoperability solutions and completely overlook the most promising aspect of blockchain adaptability, namely the smart contract. This paper fills the gap by exploring the role of smart contracts in blockchain interoperability solutions. Our research has classified the existing interoperability solutions into three main categories: heterogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, homogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, heterogeneous blockchains, and heterogeneous smart contracts. To provide a systematic overview of the smart contracts used in blockchain interoperability, each category is further divided into subcategories by identifying the functionalities of the smart contract used. Based on our survey, a taxonomy is proposed to help classify the blockchain interoperability solutions. The interoperability solutions in each category are analyzed in-depth, and the results are presented in tabular format to illustrate the characteristics of the interoperability solutions in a meaningful way. Finally, a number of open issues and research directions are discussed to overcome the limitations and improve the performance of blockchain interoperability.},

Blockchain technology (BT) promises benefits in trustability, collaboration, organization, identification, credibility, and transparency. In this paper, we conduct an analysis in which we show how open science can benefit from this technology and its properties. For this, we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystem and compared them with the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We also review literature and promising blockchain-based projects for open science to describe the current research situation. To this end, we examine the projects in particular for their relevance and contribution to open science and categorize them afterwards according to their primary purpose. Several of them already provide functionalities that can have a positive impact on current research workflows. So, BT offers promising possibilities for its use in science, but why is it then not used on a large-scale in that area? To answer this question, we point out various shortcomings, challenges, unanswered questions, and research potentials that we found in the literature and identified during our analysis. These topics shall serve as starting points for future research to foster the BT for open science and beyond, especially in the long-term.},

Data security and privacy threat permeate every link of data science industry chain, such as data production, collection, processing and sharing, and the causes of risk are complex and interwoven. Blockchain technology is highly praised and recognized for its decentralized infrastructure, anonymity, security and other characteristics. It will change the way we access and share information.

Building on the original ADR concepts, we identify four distinct types of ADR cycles for diagnosis, design, implementation, and evolution of the growing artefact-based solution. Each ADR cycle moves through activities of problem formulation, artefact creation, evaluation, reflection, and learning. Rapid iterations of ADR cycles provide a well-defined process map for managing and performing an emergent ADR project. The proposed model supports multiple entry points based on the current state of the problem environment and the goals of the ADR project. The elaborated ADR process model provides a more flexible yet disciplined inquiry into the initiation, conduct, reflection, and presentation of rigorous and relevant ADR projects.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

However, interoperability between blockchains remains an open problem. Existing approaches provide integration through solutions using a middleware system, which makes it harder to gain confidence mainly in terms of security and correctness of the process. A cross-chain protocol needs to provide a self-verifiable state-proof that embeds trust in the transfer process. We propose a Burn-to-Claim cross-chain protocol to seamlessly exchange assets between networks. Our scheme transfers assets from one blockchain system to another in a way that the asset is burned from the source blockchain and claimed on the destination blockchain. Our mechanism employs combinations of crypto mechanisms such as digital signatures and time lock to operate the protocol in a distributed manner. We provide an analysis which proves that our cross-chain protocol transfers assets correctly and securely.},

Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.},

Today, blockchains do not only act as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but have also been identified as a potentially disruptive technology in many different fields, e.g., supply chain tracking and healthcare. The widespread attention for blockchains has led to manifold research and development activities. As a result, today’s blockchain landscape is heavily fragmented, with different, incompatible technologies being available to potential users. Since interoperability between different blockchains is usually not foreseen in existing protocols and standards, functionalities like sending tokens from one participant to another, or invoking and executing smart contracts can only be carried out within a single blockchain.},

However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context. Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase. They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers' intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently. The essay describes the stages of ADR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.},

  abstract = {Design research (DR) positions information technology artifacts at the core of the Information Systems discipline. However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context. Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase. They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers' intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently. The essay describes the stages of ADR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.},

However, legacy systems built over decades using different technology stacks, make collaboration challenging and hinder efficiency. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have been proposed as a trust and efficiency mechanism for several inter organisation collaborative tasks. They can reduce friction in operations and help achieve a more streamlined and unified public service infrastructure. However, most of the work are either based on theory or purely conceptual and lack implementation. In this paper, we elaborate on the design and implementation of a proof of concept (POC) of a blockchain based interoperability and data sharing system that allows PSOs to seamlessly collaborate and share information in real time. The POC is based on the Registration of Overseas Entities and Beneficial Owners (ROEBO) legislation in the UK and demonstrates interactions between Companies House UK and other PSOs in a hybrid blockchain setting.},

Nowadays, user financial information is stored in Cloud storage instead of traditional storage, but security risks are high in financial sectors. Sometimes, Cloud services providers and public auditors modify the user sensitive attribute values. Hence, the decentralized storage system is required for providing better security and integrity of user sensitive attribute values. Blockchain is a decentralized technology for providing tamper-proof storage for sensitive attribute values. Hence, the account holder information is segregated as sensitive and non-sensitive attributes. Before storing into off-chain mode of blocks, the sensitive attributes are grouped into ‘n' number of groups and encrypted by separate group key. The non-encrypted, non-sensitive attributes are stored in cloud storage. The access information is stored in the on-chain mode of the block for easy monitoring. Hence, the security and integrity of sensitive information are preserved.},

Nevertheless, there is a clear missing capability of cross-industry and cross-blockchain interoperability. Currently, most blockchain business networks operate in isolation without external data transfer or multi-blockchain interactions. For blockchain technology to ultimately deliver on its promise, blockchain networks must be able to scale from networks addressing individual business processes to very large scale networks of interconnected decentralized autonomous organizations addressing much larger business problems at the level of entire industries and across industries. In this paper, we envision the inception of Internet of Blockchains (IoB), where homogeneous and heterogeneous decentralized networks communicate to facilitate cross-chain transactions of value, data and state transition. In addition, we also discuss interledger techniques that are essential for enabling industry-scale blockchain networks as well as achieving scalable interconnectivity between disparate, distributed ledgers.},

Existing models of peer-to-peer systems need a revision to cover the spectrum of potential systems that can be now implemented as peer-to-peer systems. This work presents a framework to build these systems. It uses an agent-oriented approach in an open environment where agents have only partial information of the system data. The proposal covers data access, data discovery and data trust in peer-to-peer systems where different actors may interact. Moreover, the framework proposes a distributed architecture for these open systems, and provides guidelines to decide in which cases Blockchain technology may be required, or when other technologies may be sufficient.},

  abstract = {Blockchain as a novel technology has shown the capacity to transform multiple sectors. Due to opportunities such as data security, transparency, privacy and interoperability presented by decentralized applications on blockchain networks, organizations are now moving their inter-organizational functions to blockchain-based systems. Traditional system-design methods are not suitable for developing blockchain systems since they are not capable of capturing new functions that are associated with decentralized applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring existing design methods and frameworks that support the development of decentralized application on a blockchain. To achieve this, case-study based research is used in identifying current software-development techniques used in designing decentralized applications (DApp). Experts in this field are interviewed to identify their chosen techniques for designing and developing block-chain applications. Furthermore, related literature is selected to identify current techniques for DApp-designs based on the state of the art. A systematic analysis of the identified techniques is conducted using the current limitations of blockchain technology as criteria for the analyses. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose a new model-driven framework for designing blockchain applications.},

By establishing an economic model, blockchain router enables different blockchains in the network communicate with each other same like Internet network.

There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from diferent perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To ill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine speciies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges.

  abstract = {Present-day blockchain architectures all suffer from a number of issues not least practical means of extensibility and scalability. We believe this stems from tying two very important parts of the consensus architecture, namely canonicality and validity, too closely together. This paper introduces an architecture, the heterogeneous multi-chain, which fundamentally sets the two apart.},

  abstract = {As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.},

  abstract = {Supply chain finance (SCF), a proposal to address financing problems of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), aims to make working capital optimized by utilizing credit and transaction information through cooperation between upstream and downstream in the supply chain. But some demerits such as information asymmetry and the lack of trust in financing scenarios could still be witnessed in supply chain finance. Blockchain technology, with the characteristics of asymmetric encryption, decentralization, nonrepudiation, and conducting transactions without the supervision of a trusted third party, has revolved multiple stages of development. Smart contracts are regarded as an important derivative technology of blockchain, which are automatically executed by the code between multiple parties through the blockchain without relying on a trusted institution. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based supply chain financial system combining smart contracts and main methods of supply chain financing to solve the disadvantages of SCF. We select three represented financing modes to design financing platforms with the introduction of smart contracts, and present our schemes in the form of specific pseudo code. All financing processes of supply chain are conducted on the basis of ethereum blockchain. This allows SMEs which have difficulty in capital turnover in the short term, or have insufficient credit to get financial loans more easily compared with traditional financing approaches due to merits of blockchain, and also this could facilitate supply chain to improve financing efficiency for SMEs.},

  abstract = {Building trustless cross-blockchain trading protocols is challenging. Centralized exchanges thus remain the preferred route to execute transfers across blockchains. However, these services require trust and therefore undermine the very nature of the blockchains on which they operate. To overcome this, several decentralized exchanges have recently emerged which offer support for atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS). ACCS enable the trustless exchange of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and are the only known mechanism to do so. However, ACCS suffer significant limitations; they are slow, inefficient and costly, meaning that they are rarely used in practice. We present XCLAIM: the first generic framework for achieving trustless and efficient cross-chain exchanges using cryptocurrency-backed assets (CbAs). XCLAIM offers protocols for issuing, transferring, swapping and redeeming CbAs securely in a non-interactive manner on existing blockchains. We instantiate XCLAIM between Bitcoin and Ethereum and evaluate our implementation; it costs less than USD 0.50 to issue an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin-backed tokens on Ethereum. We show XCLAIM is not only faster, but also significantly cheaper than atomic cross-chain swaps. Finally, XCLAIM is compatible with the majority of existing blockchains without modification, and enables several novel cryptocurrency applications, such as cross-chain payment channels and efficient multi-party swaps.},

  abstract = {Secure and scalable data sharing is essential for collaborative clinical decision making. Conventional clinical data efforts are often siloed, however, which creates barriers to efficient information exchange and impedes effective treatment decision made for patients. This paper provides four contributions to the study of applying blockchain technology to clinical data sharing in the context of technical requirements defined in the “Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap” from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). First, we analyze the ONC requirements and their implications for blockchain-based systems. Second, we present FHIRChain, which is a blockchain-based architecture designed to meet ONC requirements by encapsulating the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for shared clinical data. Third, we demonstrate a FHIRChain-based decentralized app using digital health identities to authenticate participants in a case study of collaborative decision making for remote cancer care. Fourth, we highlight key lessons learned from our case study.},
