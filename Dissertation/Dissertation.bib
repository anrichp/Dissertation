  abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to the current state of art of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies. Blockchain is a fast-disruptive technology becoming a key instrument in share economy. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract aim to automatically and securely execute the needed responsibilities of a contract without the support of a centralized execution authority. The Smart Contract runs on top of the Blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between un-trusted parties without the interfere of third party to trust it as this Smart Contract is an executable code that runs with rules on the Blockchain. Smart Contracts have some features that serve the goals of social justice and fairness. The paper presents the basic important information about the structures of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies and conduct a comparison between the different methodologies used in the Smart Contracts. The issues faced within the Smart Contract technology are surveyed. The four key issues are identified as: codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. We survey case cases of usage of the Blockchain in various business sectors like real estate, voting system and supply chain. The paper aims to assist a developer to grasp the big picture of the Blockchain technology and to further assist in the decision process of suitability of the technology to a specific application area.},

  abstract = {Blockchain databases are storage systems that combine properties of blockchains and databases like decentralization, tamperproofness, low query latency and support for complex queries. Blockchain databases are an emerging and important class of blockchain technology that is critical to the development of non-trivial smart contracts, distributed applications and decentralized marketplaces. In this work, we consider the problem of designing end-to-end encrypted blockchain databases to support the development of decentralized applications that need to store and query sensitive data. In particular, we show how to design what we call blockchain encrypted multi-maps (EMM) which can be used to instantiate various kinds of NoSQL blockchain databases like key-value stores or document databases. We propose three blockchain EMM constructions, each of which achieves different tradeoffs between query, add and delete efficiency. All of our constructions are legacy-friendly in the sense that they can be implemented on top of any existing blockchain. This is particularly challenging since blockchains do not support data deletion. We implemented our schemes on the Algorand blockchain and evaluated their concrete efficiency empirically. Our experiments show that they are practical.},

Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a medical record that can be accessed and have certain limitations. The challenge in implementing MR is how to be able to collect, store, and analyze patient data in a comprehensive and integrated manner without having to violate patient privacy. The implementation of MR is how to transmit data between hospitals. To solve the problems and issues faced in implementing MR, there is a technology that can overcome this, one of which is using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that managed by many participants in an availability manner. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that anyone can use to create and deploy decentralized applications that run on the blockchain network. The data stored on the Ethereum blockchain will always be there and can be seen as long as the blockchain network is still online. With ethereum, the process of sharing data will be easy to do using a computer belonging to the hospital as a blockchain node. The result of implementing blockchain into medical record is now the data can be shared securely between hospitals.},

  abstract = {SQL Ledger is a new technology that allows cryptographically verifying the integrity of relational data stored in Azure SQL Database and SQL Server. This is achieved by maintaining all historical data in the database and persisting its cryptographic (SHA-256) digests in an immutable, tamper-evident ledger. Digests representing the overall state of the ledger can then be extracted and stored outside of the RDBMS to protect the data from any attacker or high privileged user, including DBAs, system and cloud administrators. The ledger and the historical data are managed transparently, offering protection without any application changes. Historical data is maintained in a relational form to support SQL queries for auditing, forensics and other purposes. SQL Ledger provides cryptographic data integrity guarantees while maintaining the power, flexibility and performance of a commercial RDBMS. In contrast to Blockchain solutions that aim for full integrity, SQL Ledger offers a form of integrity protection known as Forward Integrity. The proposed technology is significantly cheaper and more secure than traditional solutions that establish trust based on audits or mediators, but also has substantial advantages over Blockchain solutions that are complex to deploy, lack data management capabilities and suffer in terms of performance due to their decentralized nature.},

But, Blockchain is a secure system where the transactional history regarding crypto-currency cannot be modified or destructed. Since 2008, Blockchain has gained immense interest due to exclusion of third-party organization participation in monitoring of the transactions. Ethereum is a protocol which is based on Blockchain technology and has several benefits over other crypto-currency based system and is best suited for creating a secure lending system. Every Ethereum based system runs on ‘Smart-Contracts’ which are lines of code and makes the system automated. As the system gets automated, proper algorithms can make the system reliable and secure as each and every step of the system is maintained and executed by the algorithm inside the Smart-Contracts. Blockchain systems work with peer-to-peer networks and also uses a consensus algorithm that’s why there is no possibility of data modification.},

This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain’s novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.},

  abstract = {Blockchain interoperability is emerging as one of the crucial features of blockchain technology, but the knowledge necessary for achieving it is fragmented. This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain’s novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.},

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a systematic literature review (SLR) of 346 research products available on Scopus, which were mapped with bibliometric analyses and critically discussed in relation to three main topics: the impact of blockchain on accounting and auditing, cryptoassets and finance, business models and supply chain management. Findings Blockchain has many potential implications for accounting practice and research. In addition to providing the state-of-the-art of accounting research on blockchain and additional avenues for further studies, this study discusses why practitioners are interested in this technology: triple-entry bookkeeping, the inalterability of transactions, the automation of repetitive tasks that do not require discretionary choices, the representation of cryptocurrencies in financial statements, value-chain management, social and environmental auditing and reporting and business model innovation. Originality/value The novel contribution of this study is integrated and threefold. First, this SLR provides a clear picture of the state of the accounting research on blockchain using bibliographic and narrative analyses. Second, it investigates how accounting and auditing practices are impacted by blockchain. Third, it contributes to the accounting literature with its discussion of the potential future research trends related to blockchain for accounting.},

  abstract = {Blockchain has emerged as a key technology for ensuring reliability and security in several application areas primarily including the healthcare sector. Blockchain is a distributed ledger where blocks of transactions are connected in a chain using the cryptographic hash function of the previous block, making it an append-only structure. Any modification on any of the blocks will generate different hash values in other blocks in a cascading manner and different link relations. In this way the blockchain achieves immutability and security. Blockchain also involves consensus mechanisms in order to ensure synchronization among blocks and agreement between existing nodes to add a new transaction in the chain. Healthcare data is highly sensitive in nature, which consists of private information related to the diagnosis and treatment of patients. In traditional approach these data are stored by each hospital separately where sharing data is very time consuming. Also, health data is very limited to access due to the risk of disclosure of sensitive information. In order to address these issues, the objective of this paper is to integrate blockchain technology with healthcare records/data in order to provide better sharing of data without the fear of data tampering or security breach.},

To solve the existing problem with interoperability, as a main motivation for this paper, we introduce an adapter, which can read various types of statements and return an XML file as output. Our realization of the adapter works with statements offered by most of the banks in our country as a proof of concept. The adapter was efficiently used in a special program for analysis of consumer costs, where one can access accounts in several banks and calculate taxes, income statements and analyze the costs.},

  abstract = {With the innovation of distributed ledger technology (DLT), often known as blockchain technology, there has been significant growth of digital tokens in the form of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies. As the number of DLT networks increases, each with varying design characteristics, the likelihood that transacting parties are on the same network decreases. Thus, it is crucial to facilitate payments that are universal across networks, scalable to massive loads, and highly available. We envision a future payment network that may be built on top of DLT networks without being subject to their limitations on interoperability, scalability, and availability faced by DLT payment solutions today. Specifically, we propose a hub-and-spoke payment route, referred to here as Universal Payment Channels (UPC), that can be used to support digital token transfers of funds across different networks through payment channels. We further discuss the potential use cases of the UPC technology to support, and not complicate, an already robust digital payment ecosystem. Finally, through the paper, we share some future directions of the UPC technology.},

The blockchain technology can optimize the global financial infrastructure, achieving sustainable development, using more efficient systems than at present. In fact, many banks are currently focusing on blockchain technology to promote economic growth and accelerate the development of green technologies. In order to understand the potential of blockchain technology to support the financial system, we studied the actual performance of the Bitcoin system, also highlighting its major limitations, such as the significant energy consumption due to the high computing power required, and the high cost of hardware. We estimated the electrical power and the hash rate of the Bitcoin network, over time, and, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the Bitcoin system in its actual operation, we defined three quantities: “economic efficiency”, “operational efficiency”, and “efficient service”. The obtained results show that by overcoming the disadvantages of the Bitcoin system, and therefore of blockchain technology, we could be able to handle financial processes in a more efficient way than under the current system.},

Intended to revolutionise the payments process, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (and therefore distributed) ‘electronic cash system’ that facilitates relatively fast online payments with low transaction costs and ‘without going through a financial institution’. As a currency, it is perhaps not surprising that bitcoin has been met with both scepticism from the public and resistance from traditional financial institutions. In contrast, as a platform, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) that underpins bitcoin (known as the blockchain) is now witnessing mainstream adoption by major financial institutions. This transition comes as banks and other financial institutions are recognising the blockchain’s significant potential to ‘radically transform’ the financial services industry, resulting in what some are calling the ‘fourth industrial revolution’. As a consequence, it is becoming increasingly clear that DLTs have the potential to similarly disrupt the shadow banking sector as they enable innovative business models to be adopted by both banks (acting outside of the traditional regulated realm) and non-bank institutions (to conduct financial services activities).},

In this article, through an in-depth investigation of the technology innovation evaluation process, we utilize a grounded theory approach to study 12 financial service organizations. This article is unique in that it explores the technology evaluation process concurrently as decision makers reacted to the potential uses, as opposed to a retrospective view after a technology innovation had been adopted. Evidence suggests that, organizations applied a specific process to determine the value of blockchain that consisted of understand, organize, and test, which collectively helped create the proof-of-value model. Surprisingly, we find that financial service organizations tend to view blockchain innovation as a lower priority due to the lack of a clear path to value. Additionally, financial service organizations consistently leverage industry consortiums to link to external knowledge and help with the decision-making process. Our findings have direct implications to both innovation researchers as well as practitioners seeking to evaluate blockchain technology.},

Advances in trending technologies have contributed to their adaptation in every part of human’s daily routine. Almost all healthcare-associated domains are now adapting to eHealth. Health professionals have been able to collect medical records, exchange medical data through a network of professionals and patients, provide healthcare through digital media, and track various health-related events, diseases, and disease outbreaks through a range of technologies, such as social media sites, applications, smartphones, and smart objects. This has resulted in an ample amount of knowledge related to patients that is created and needs to be handled effectively for better results. Although big data is the obvious option to handle this vast data collection, data protection and security for public health data is a prime concern. A blockchain is known as a record database located in a distributed personal computer network called nodes. In particular, it is a mutual, permanent record of peer-to-peer transactions constructed from linked blocks of transactions and stored in a digital ledger. No single person owns it, i.e., it is decentralized. The healthcare sector is one of the sectors looking to embrace the blockchain. This chapter aims to reflect the numerous facts leading to the introduction of blockchain technology in general and electronic medical record management of healthcare in particular. The chapter will study the various blockchain implementation frameworks.},

For example, M-Pesa provides distributed banking service in the developing regions so that the people without a bank account can deposit, withdraw, or transfer money. The current distributed banking systems lack the transparency in monitoring and tracking of distributed banking transactions and thus do not support auditing of distributed banking transactions for accountability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain-based distributed banking (BDB) scheme, which uses blockchain technology to leverage its built-in properties to record and track immutable transactions. BDB supports distributed financial transaction processing but is significantly different from cryptocurrencies in its design properties, simplicity, and computational efficiency. We implement a prototype of BDB using smart contract and conduct experiments to show BDB’s effectiveness and performance. We further compare our prototype with the Ethereum cryptocurrency to highlight the fundamental differences and demonstrate the BDB’s superior computational efficiency.},

RPOW uses hashcash, which are values whose SHA-1 hashes have many high bits of zeros. Normally POW tokens can't be reused because that would allow them to be double-spent. But RPOW allows for a limited form of reuse: sequential reuse. This lets a POW token be used once, then exchanged for a new one, which can again be used once, then once more exchanged, etc. This approach makes POW tokens more practical for many purposes and allows the effective cost of a POW token to be raised while still allowing systems to use them effectively.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology is a disruptive technology which has revolutionised the conventional business models, traditional business transaction work flows and opening the door to huge opportunities of business value co-creations. Blockchain holds the promise to disrupt various industries and organisations, and one of the most well-known areas is its applications to the banking and finance sector. This qualitative study has analysed state-of-the-art blockchain research and technology in the banking and finance sector. Firstly, we selected and reviewed 76 literature in the banking and finance sector from 2016 to 2020 and provided a critical bibliometric review of existing literature. Secondly, we applied the well-known thematic analysis methodology to systematically identify the hot research topics, five potential business benefits and three types of potential challenges of applying blockchain technology to the banking and finance sector. Finally, we concluded by summarising the limitations of our study and subsequently highlighted future research directions. Despite several studies in other fields, no systematic review has thus far synthesised the research on blockchain application in this field to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Hence, the current study provides a starting point for future research and facilitates the work of both academic scholars and industry practitioners.},

  abstract = {With the increasing adoption of private blockchain platforms, consortia operating in various sectors such as trade, finance, logistics, etc., are becoming common. Despite having the benefits of a completely decentralized architecture which supports transparency and distributed control, existing private blockchains limit the data, assets, and processes within its closed boundary, which restricts secure and verifiable service provisioning to the end-consumers. Thus, platforms such as e-commerce with multiple sellers or cloud federation with a collection of cloud service providers cannot be decentralized with the existing blockchain platforms. This paper proposes a decentralized gateway architecture interfacing private blockchain with end-users by leveraging the unique combination of public and private blockchain platforms through interoperation. Through the use case of decentralized cloud federations, we have demonstrated the viability of the solution. Our testbed implementation with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, with three service providers, shows that such consortium can operate within an acceptable response latency while scaling up to 64 parallel requests per second for cloud infrastructure provisioning. Further analysis over the Mininet emulation platform indicates that the platform can scale well with minimal impact over the latency as the number of participating service providers increases.},

  abstract = {Interoperability in healthcare has traditionally been focused around data exchange between business entities, for example, different hospital systems. However, there has been a recent push towards patient-driven interoperability, in which health data exchange is patient-mediated and patient-driven. Patient-centered interoperability, however, brings with it new challenges and requirements around security and privacy, technology, incentives, and governance that must be addressed for this type of data sharing to succeed at scale. In this paper, we look at how blockchain technology might facilitate this transition through five mechanisms: (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation, (3) data liquidity, (4) patient identity, and (5) data immutability. We then look at barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability, specifically clinical data transaction volume, privacy and security, patient engagement, and incentives. We conclude by noting that while patient-driving interoperability is an exciting trend in healthcare, given these challenges, it remains to be seen whether blockchain can facilitate the transition from institution-centric to patient-centric data sharing.},

On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of “multi-center, weakly intermediated” scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a “regulatory sandbox” and the development of industry standards.},

Several challenges in blockchain technology remain to be addressed, including the interoperability, survivability, and manageability of blockchain systems. Crucial to answering these challenges is the need to understand aspects of the Internet architecture that has made it scalable, resilient, and a commercial success as a global connectivity infrastructure. In this paper, we discuss a design philosophy for interoperable blockchain systems, using the design philosophy of the Internet architecture as the basis to identify key design principles. We recast some of the challenges faced in the design of the Internet architecture to that of the design of an interoperable blockchain architecture. We emphasize interoperability as a crucial requirement for the survivability and manageability of blockchain systems. The goal is to define an interoperable blockchain architecture, in which common components of the blockchain architecture can begin to be standardized, leading to lowering of development costs, better reusability, and higher degree of interoperability.},

Ideally the Internet infrastructure needs a distributed and tamper-resistant resource management framework which cannot be subverted by any single entity. A secure, distributed ledger enables such a mechanism and the blockchain is the best known example of distributed ledgers. In this paper, we propose the use of a blockchain based mechanism to secure the Internet BGP and DNS infrastructure. While the blockchain has scaling issues to be overcome, the key advantages of such an approach include the elimination of any PKI-like root of trust, a verifiable and distributed transaction history log, multi-signature based authorizations for enhanced security, easy extensibility and scriptable programmability to secure new types of Internet resources and potential for a built in cryptocurrency. A tamper resistant DNS infrastructure also ensures that it is not possible for the application level PKI to spoof HTTPS traffic.},

With a theoretical lens based on institutional theory from the political science field, the analysis shows that interoperability is not just a technical issue and that economic and political factors are just as important when implementing enterprise architecture programs in government. The findings suggest that implementing enterprise architectures in government challenge the way information systems are organized and governed in public agencies and calls for a broader definition of interoperability. The case study indicates that interoperability challenges arise because there is no overall coordination of different information systems initiatives in the health sector and because public hospitals have no economic and/or immediate political incentives to share data and business functionality with other organizations.},

For main industry stakeholders, the priority is to ensure integrity and interoperability across the care continuum. Achieving this priority is still challenging considering an enormous amount of EHR data, security issues, and heterogeneity of healthcare information systems. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes BiiMED: a Blockchain framework for Enhancing Data Interoperability and Integrity regarding EHR-sharing. The proposed solutions include an access management system allowing the exchange of EHRs between different medical providers and a decentralized Trusted Third Party Auditor (TTPA) for ensuring data integrity.

Some target a particular niche market such as supply chain and financial services, while others strive to differentiate themselves from the increasingly saturated market by offering new functionality. This dynamic and constantly changing blockchain ecosystem makes it very challenging to keep abreast of all the latest breakthroughs and research. It is evident that there is also a growing desire to collaborate with others developing blockchain solutions, which brings new impetus to blockchain interoperability research. We review the strategies that some key players in the blockchain ecosystem have implemented, or are proposing to develop, to satisfy this increasing demand for cross-chain communication and transactions between sidechains. Interoperability presents a complex and challenging stumbling block to the wider uptake of blockchain technology. We find that although there is a plethora of blockchains and interoperability implementations, or proposals, at a higher level of abstraction there is only a handful of approaches. However, the way they are implemented can differ quite substantially. We present a summary of the reviews we conducted in a table for ease of comparing and contrasting.},

Despite such advancements, the application of blockchain to accounting and assurance remains under-explored. This paper aims to provide an initial discussion on how blockchain could enable a real-time, verifiable, and transparent accounting ecosystem. Additionally, blockchain has the potential to transform current auditing practices, resulting in a more precise and timely automatic assurance system.},

  abstract = {The slower than expected adoption rate of blockchain technology has highlighted that there are barriers due to the diversity of its applications and its users. To overcome this limitation and take full advantage of the novel technology, researchers from academia as well as industry are dedicated to find different solutions, where two or more blockchains can interact with each other. As a result, several interoperability solutions have presented themselves. To investigate the functionalities and underlying mechanisms of interoperable blockchain solutions, researchers have conducted several surveys by discussing the features and innovations of these methods. However, the existing surveys tend to focus on the architectural description of the interoperability solutions and completely overlook the most promising aspect of blockchain adaptability, namely the smart contract. This paper fills the gap by exploring the role of smart contracts in blockchain interoperability solutions. Our research has classified the existing interoperability solutions into three main categories: heterogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, homogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, heterogeneous blockchains, and heterogeneous smart contracts. To provide a systematic overview of the smart contracts used in blockchain interoperability, each category is further divided into subcategories by identifying the functionalities of the smart contract used. Based on our survey, a taxonomy is proposed to help classify the blockchain interoperability solutions. The interoperability solutions in each category are analyzed in-depth, and the results are presented in tabular format to illustrate the characteristics of the interoperability solutions in a meaningful way. Finally, a number of open issues and research directions are discussed to overcome the limitations and improve the performance of blockchain interoperability.},

Failures of interoperability can lead to adverse events such as medical or communication errors at the clinical level or inefficient use of services at the organizational or regional level. However interoperability is a multi-faceted concept that must take place at the clinical, organizational and regional levels. Thus we need to look at healthcare interoperability from an overall system perspective. Various eHealth technologies provide the tools to facilitate integration but those tools must be used within a framework that integrates all users of the system across the various levels. This paper presents an eBusiness based framework for eHealth interoperability that maps specific processes and tools and applications to the multiple levels of the healthcare system. The framework can help us focus research and system development efforts to enable eHealth integration.},

However, it might be of interest to make two different blockchains interoperable, i.e., to allow one to transmit information from one blockchain to another blockchain. In this paper, we give a formalisation of this problem, and we prove that blockchain interoperability is impossible according to the classical definition of a blockchain. Under a weaker definition of blockchain, we demonstrate that two blockchains are interoperable is equivalent to creating a ‘2-in-1’ blockchain containing both ledgers, thus limiting the theoretical interest of making interoperable blockchains in the first place. We also observe that all practical existing interoperable blockchain frameworks work indeed by exchanging already created tokens between two blockchains and not by offering the possibility to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another one, which implies a modification of the balance of total created tokens on both blockchains. It confirms that having interoperability is only possible by creating a ‘2-in-1’ blockchain containing both ledgers.},

Blockchain technology (BT) promises benefits in trustability, collaboration, organization, identification, credibility, and transparency. In this paper, we conduct an analysis in which we show how open science can benefit from this technology and its properties. For this, we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystem and compared them with the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We also review literature and promising blockchain-based projects for open science to describe the current research situation. To this end, we examine the projects in particular for their relevance and contribution to open science and categorize them afterwards according to their primary purpose. Several of them already provide functionalities that can have a positive impact on current research workflows. So, BT offers promising possibilities for its use in science, but why is it then not used on a large-scale in that area? To answer this question, we point out various shortcomings, challenges, unanswered questions, and research potentials that we found in the literature and identified during our analysis. These topics shall serve as starting points for future research to foster the BT for open science and beyond, especially in the long-term.},

  abstract = {Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and other medical data contain important and sensitive privacy information of patients, which provide important basis and reference for their doctors to diagnose and treat them. With the continuous development of data sharing, big data applications and other technologies, new requirements are proposed for the storage of medical privacy data. At present, medical data have the characteristics of obstructed sharing and exchange, difficult data tracing and data sensitivity, which increases the cost and difficulty of each diagnosis. Moreover, patients lack the right to know and control their own medical data, which is easy to cause data fraud or data leakage. As a decentralized, tamper proof and traceable distributed ledger system, blockchain brings new solutions to these problems. This paper designs a medical data fusion and distributed privacy management system based on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain development platform and InterPlanetary File System. It can not only solve the problem of mutual distrust in the traditional system, but also realize the safe data storage and the safe sharing of medical record data between medical organizations which is a beneficial attempt to overcome the disadvantages of traditional hospital data separation. At the same time, according to the requirements of different levels and types of medical users or groups for data security and personal privacy protection, the access control technology of users is studied to ensure personal privacy data.},

Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchange between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchange. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in about 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiment results show that HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications},

  abstract = {Currently, Smart Cities use computational solutions that promote services to improve the quality of life of the entire population. However, these systems are often heterogeneous and designed in an isolated way that makes it challenging to integrate with each other. One of the ways to integrate systems that provide interoperability is the System-of-system concept. Communication among systems depends on mutual agreements made by intermediaries. It increases the cost, constrains collaboration, and distrusts shared data and services. Blockchain can fulfill these gaps and be a trusted decentralized controller entity based on a consensus mechanism among network participants. This Early-stage paper presents an initial doctoral research proposal on how to combine Blockchain with Systems-of-Systems concepts to provide trusted interoperability between Smart Cities systems.},

  abstract = {Blockchain is a technology for decentralized transactions that has been widely used with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Many studies have been conducted in the last decades, approaching cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology, more strongly in the context of financial transactions. However, little has been done to provide a panoramic view of the current literature; as a consequence, a careful understanding of the state-of-the-art papers remains limited and inconclusive. This study, therefore, aims to classify and provide a thematic analysis of studies on the use of blockchain in the context of financial area, thus allowing to create a clear systematic map of the current literature, and identify challenges and research opportunities. To achieve these objectives a systematic mapping study (SMS) approach was performed to answer 6 research questions. In total, 1884 studies were reviewed from 6 data sources, being 23 studies selected after a careful filtering process. The main findings were: (1) Over 65\% of the selected studies concentrated on adopting two blockchain platforms named Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum; (2) Over 60\% used blockchain technology to increase security; (3) Most studies did not reveal the consensus algorithm used; (4) Fintech (or Bank) and loan were the most explored application areas; (5) Over 60\% focused on producing prototype rather than frameworks; and (6) most studies were published in conferences. This study can benefit research community by generating a map of the literature, serving as a starting point for future researches. Moreover, this study reports some challenges worth investigating.},

  abstract = {The achievement of interoperability between public administrations across Europe is considered to be a crucial factor for the delivery of efficient, cost-effective and transparent public services. There are still many challenges and limitations to be faced, due to technical, semantic, legal and organizational factors. The importance of organizational interoperability towards information integration has been known for years. Nowadays, it still remains an enduring challenge and undoubtedly gains momentum due to the complexity of organizational aspect as the public organizations move toward inter-organizational governance as well as due to the enforcement of new policies such as Once Only principle and Open data. This paper initially highlights the importance of organizational interoperability in e-Government and the need to define metrics in order to assess the degree of organizational interoperability. A brief literature review on existing assessment tools, frameworks and models is presented. The development of a new model and tool for the assessment of organizational interoperability maturity of a digital public service, based on a referential model along with conceptual attributes, is thoroughly presented. The new approach can be used as an independent assessment model/tool in the area of organizational interoperability, while it could furthermore extend the IMAPS tool.},

Building on the original ADR concepts, we identify four distinct types of ADR cycles for diagnosis, design, implementation, and evolution of the growing artefact-based solution. Each ADR cycle moves through activities of problem formulation, artefact creation, evaluation, reflection, and learning. Rapid iterations of ADR cycles provide a well-defined process map for managing and performing an emergent ADR project. The proposed model supports multiple entry points based on the current state of the problem environment and the goals of the ADR project. The elaborated ADR process model provides a more flexible yet disciplined inquiry into the initiation, conduct, reflection, and presentation of rigorous and relevant ADR projects.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we design and implement the first-ever decentralized replicated relational database with blockchain properties that we term blockchain relational database. We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.},

This study will help provide a holistic framework that would highlight the current state and challenges of the blockchain in the financial services sector. Design/methodology/approach The objective of this study is to systematically examine and organize the current body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored the use of blockchain technology in financial services. The study uses PRISMA-guided systematic review along with bibliometric analysis to achieve the purpose. Findings This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring and analyzing systematic studies available on blockchain with special reference to financial services sector. With blockchain based on five principles, namely, computational logic, peer-to-peer transmission, irreversibility of records, distributed database and transparency with pseudonym has immense potential to unleash and transform the financial service industry. With increasing blockchain-based operations of decentralized banking, insurance, trade finance, financial markets and cryptocurrency market, the subject is rapidly growing and seeking considerable contribution from scholars from around the world. Research limitations/implications This study uses systematic literature review approach, which has its own demerits. Like other studies based on Systematic Literature Review, this study also suffers from a certain bias such as sample selection bias, publication bias, data interpretation and the combination of quantitative and qualitative studies in the population. Further, the adoption and resultant benefits of blockchain have not been empirically tested. Practical implications This study can help policymakers and institutions in determining their future course of action, as it highlights the state of research in the area of blockchain technology and financial services. Originality/value Very few studies have done a comprehensive review of literature on blockchain in financial services.},

With a final sample of 154 papers published between 2009 and 2021, we map their influential aspects, in terms of trending topic, authors and target journals. We then provide a bibliographic analysis, which consists of co-authorship, cartographic, co-citation and coupling analyses. Finally, we identify the main literature streams and the future research agenda, which may serve as a valid starting point for future research in the field for both scholars and practitioners.},

However, interoperability between blockchains remains an open problem. Existing approaches provide integration through solutions using a middleware system, which makes it harder to gain confidence mainly in terms of security and correctness of the process. A cross-chain protocol needs to provide a self-verifiable state-proof that embeds trust in the transfer process. We propose a Burn-to-Claim cross-chain protocol to seamlessly exchange assets between networks. Our scheme transfers assets from one blockchain system to another in a way that the asset is burned from the source blockchain and claimed on the destination blockchain. Our mechanism employs combinations of crypto mechanisms such as digital signatures and time lock to operate the protocol in a distributed manner. We provide an analysis which proves that our cross-chain protocol transfers assets correctly and securely.},

A business model acts as a mediator for IT innovation. To test the hypothesis model data provided from an international survey of 104 financial services institutions and start-up companies was applied. The results support the hypothesis that all three value disciplines might be impacted by blockchain technology in the future. The regression analysis reveals that especially banks’ operations could be significantly changed. With these results, this research contributes to the emerging literature on blockchain and business models and the strategic use of IT.},

  abstract = {In this study, a higher level of security was implemented by using InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) based peer-to-peer data storage on an Ethereum blockchain. IPFS is used as an image data storage medium that generates an IPFS hash, or known as content identifier (CID). The CID is used to access image data on the IPFS, which can be done with the help of an IPFS gateway. The CID is sent into the blockchain using a smart contract. The results of the study demonstrates that the use of IPFS as additional security on a blockchain system can be done. The size of file sent using IPFS proportionally affects the time it takes for IPFS to store the file. The larger the file size, the more time it will take. For each additional 1 MB file, there is an approximately 5\% increase in access time. The distance from the IPFS gateway will also affect file access times in which, the farther the IPFS gateway, the more time it takes. If the IPFS gateway is at a distance of 1,000 km, there will be a decrease in access time of about 5\%. The distance between the IPFS gateway and the accessor also affects success with accessing data. For the most distant gateway, i.e. the United States, there was even an access failure of 24\%.},

Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.},

  abstract = {Today, the majority of banks offer many different online services to their customers and our study case will focus specifically on domestic and international banking transactions. By doing these services, these banks use enough time to conduct bank transactions from one bank account to another, some of which take more than a week, under a security that does not fully respect the privacy of operators and under the mercy of certain third party's services. Unfortunately, these banks face the limitations of payment systems (such as SWIFT, SEPA, and union pay) for international transactions and other banking exchange services. To remedy these problems of third-party trust, exaggerated latency, payment of high transaction fees, problems of theft and falsification of banking information, we will set up a storage and bank exchange platform, based on a private and confidential blockchain. In this platform, a number of authorized users will be able to hold and operate the nodes that will support the network. Nowhere in the world is there a system that directly connects banks, currencies and financial institutions without a trusted third party. In our case, these sworn users are banks. This platform will eliminate the presence of the trusted third party which is the third entity through which the various transactions and banking information must pass. To begin with, our platform will eliminate third-party trust, promote user-user transactions and then store bank transaction information in the blockchain. Our blockchain platform will allow users to make secure and confidential transactions at a lower cost and without a foreign exchange ban due to a maximum amount not to exceed as with the case of banks.},

However, legacy systems built over decades using different technology stacks, make collaboration challenging and hinder efficiency. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have been proposed as a trust and efficiency mechanism for several inter organisation collaborative tasks. They can reduce friction in operations and help achieve a more streamlined and unified public service infrastructure. However, most of the work are either based on theory or purely conceptual and lack implementation. In this paper, we elaborate on the design and implementation of a proof of concept (POC) of a blockchain based interoperability and data sharing system that allows PSOs to seamlessly collaborate and share information in real time.

Nowadays, user financial information is stored in Cloud storage instead of traditional storage, but security risks are high in financial sectors. Sometimes, Cloud services providers and public auditors modify the user sensitive attribute values. Hence, the decentralized storage system is required for providing better security and integrity of user sensitive attribute values. Blockchain is a decentralized technology for providing tamper-proof storage for sensitive attribute values. Hence, the account holder information is segregated as sensitive and non-sensitive attributes. Before storing into off-chain mode of blocks, the sensitive attributes are grouped into ‘n' number of groups and encrypted by separate group key. The non-encrypted, non-sensitive attributes are stored in cloud storage. The access information is stored in the on-chain mode of the block for easy monitoring. Hence, the security and integrity of sensitive information are preserved.},

  abstract = {Banking sector contributes to 70\% of Indian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and for India to meet its economic aspirations, it should enable this vivacious sector to grow at 8–10 times of its current pace, in the next ten years. This pace of active growth requires a double engine of sophisticated technology and a tech enabled, scalable, and a secured banking system. Implementing BlockchainBlockchain~Technology (BCT) in the banking sector, provides a realistic solution which when coupled with devices connected by the Internet of ThingsInternet of Things~(IoT), will result in secured, fast-paced, cost effective, and transparent growth of the sector. The prevalence of personalized banking, secured banking, connected bankingConnected banking, and digital banking are use cases, made possible through interface with IoT. This chapter delves into the opportunities in the banking sector to be explored and challenges to be met in the BCT-IoT implementation process. BCT- and IoT-based opportunities such as peer-to-peer lending, Know Your Customer (KYC) updation, Cross-border transfer payments, syndicate lendingSyndicate lending, fraudFraud reduction are some of the banking operations that are elaborated. To strengthen the banking network, the consensus algorithm of BlockchainBlockchain~network is much required and the use of IoT devices to act as nodes is pertinent. The blend of both in the banking space has to be further reinforced.Internet of Things},

Nevertheless, there is a clear missing capability of cross-industry and cross-blockchain interoperability. Currently, most blockchain business networks operate in isolation without external data transfer or multi-blockchain interactions. For blockchain technology to ultimately deliver on its promise, blockchain networks must be able to scale from networks addressing individual business processes to very large scale networks of interconnected decentralized autonomous organizations addressing much larger business problems at the level of entire industries and across industries. In this paper, we envision the inception of Internet of Blockchains (IoB), where homogeneous and heterogeneous decentralized networks communicate to facilitate cross-chain transactions of value, data and state transition. In addition, we also discuss interledger techniques that are essential for enabling industry-scale blockchain networks as well as achieving scalable interconnectivity between disparate, distributed ledgers.},

These innovations have tackled technical challenges that were unresolved until their appearance. Existing models of peer-to-peer systems need a revision to cover the spectrum of potential systems that can be now implemented as peer-to-peer systems. This work presents a framework to build these systems. It uses an agent-oriented approach in an open environment where agents have only partial information of the system data. The proposal covers data access, data discovery and data trust in peer-to-peer systems where different actors may interact. Moreover, the framework proposes a distributed architecture for these open systems, and provides guidelines to decide in which cases Blockchain technology may be required, or when other technologies may be sufficient.},

  abstract = {Blockchain as a novel technology has shown the capacity to transform multiple sectors. Due to opportunities such as data security, transparency, privacy and interoperability presented by decentralized applications on blockchain networks, organizations are now moving their inter-organizational functions to blockchain-based systems. Traditional system-design methods are not suitable for developing blockchain systems since they are not capable of capturing new functions that are associated with decentralized applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring existing design methods and frameworks that support the development of decentralized application on a blockchain. To achieve this, case-study based research is used in identifying current software-development techniques used in designing decentralized applications (DApp). Experts in this field are interviewed to identify their chosen techniques for designing and developing block-chain applications. Furthermore, related literature is selected to identify current techniques for DApp-designs based on the state of the art. A systematic analysis of the identified techniques is conducted using the current limitations of blockchain technology as criteria for the analyses. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose a new model-driven framework for designing blockchain applications.},

Currently, Blockchain operates like information isolated island, they cannot obtain external data or execute transactions on their own. Motivated by recent studies [1-3] on blockchain's multiChain framework, we investigate the cross-chain communication. We introduces blockchain router, which empowers blockchains to connect and communicate cross chains. By establishing an economic model, blockchain router enables different blockchains in the network communicate with each other same like Internet network. In the network of blockchain router, some blockchain plays the role of a router which, according to the communication protocol, analyzes and transmits communication requests, dynamically maintaining a topology structure of the blockchain network.},

Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will definitely revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of Internet. The development of crossblockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. The way to effectively enable interoperability across multiple blockchains is thus essential and expecting to confront various unprecedented challenges. For instance, due to different transaction structures, ensuring the properties of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) in transactions processing and verification processes across diverse blockchain systems remains a challenging task in both academia and industry. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the current progress of blockchain interoperability. We explore both general principles and practical schemes to achieve interoperable blockchain systems. We then survey and compare the state-of-the-art solutions to deal with the interoperability of blockchains in detail. Finally, we discuss several critical challenges and some potential research directions to advance the research on exploring blockchain interoperability.},

However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To ill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine speciies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems. CCS Concepts: · Information systems → Data management systems; Distributed storage.},

It has rushed into all walks of life with the power of breaking a bamboo, and is shining around the world. According to the basic functions of blockchain technology (BT), such as information tampering. Information transparency has certain security guarantees. This kind of security guarantee can ensure the reliability of the financial information system to a large extent and reduce financial fraud. The aim of this article is to study the application of regional chain technology in the financial field (FF). This article is based on the primary principles of blockchain, information asymmetry theory and moral theory. Through questionnaire surveys, corporate financial personnel, middle and high-level managers and other authorities, university researchers, scholars and other personnel with experience in the implementation and application of financial informationization in various industries to ensure the right and precise results of this survey with authority and credibility. It is helpful to improve the quality problems in the financial information processing process, and helps the company implement effective real-time and automatic control. Experimental investigations and studies have shown, Financial information quality issues have the highest score at 4.39 points, while management and control issues and security issues have scores of 4.26 and 4.22 points, respectively. That there is no doubt that the blockchain financial system(FS) has many advantages, but because the BT is still in its infancy, the research time is relatively short, and there are many unresolved and unidentified problems and deficiencies.},

  abstract = {As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.},

  abstract = {Building trustless cross-blockchain trading protocols is challenging. Centralized exchanges thus remain the preferred route to execute transfers across blockchains. However, these services require trust and therefore undermine the very nature of the blockchains on which they operate. To overcome this, several decentralized exchanges have recently emerged which offer support for atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS). ACCS enable the trustless exchange of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and are the only known mechanism to do so. However, ACCS suffer significant limitations; they are slow, inefficient and costly, meaning that they are rarely used in practice. We present XCLAIM: the first generic framework for achieving trustless and efficient cross-chain exchanges using cryptocurrency-backed assets (CbAs). XCLAIM offers protocols for issuing, transferring, swapping and redeeming CbAs securely in a non-interactive manner on existing blockchains. We instantiate XCLAIM between Bitcoin and Ethereum and evaluate our implementation; it costs less than USD 0.50 to issue an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin-backed tokens on Ethereum. We show XCLAIM is not only faster, but also significantly cheaper than atomic cross-chain swaps. Finally, XCLAIM is compatible with the majority of existing blockchains without modification, and enables several novel cryptocurrency applications, such as cross-chain payment channels and efficient multi-party swaps.},

  abstract = {Secure and scalable data sharing is essential for collaborative clinical decision making. Conventional clinical data efforts are often siloed, however, which creates barriers to efficient information exchange and impedes effective treatment decision made for patients. This paper provides four contributions to the study of applying blockchain technology to clinical data sharing in the context of technical requirements defined in the “Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap” from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). First, we analyze the ONC requirements and their implications for blockchain-based systems. Second, we present FHIRChain, which is a blockchain-based architecture designed to meet ONC requirements by encapsulating the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for shared clinical data. Third, we demonstrate a FHIRChain-based decentralized app using digital health identities to authenticate participants in a case study of collaborative decision making for remote cancer care. Fourth, we highlight key lessons learned from our case study.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to clarify common misconceptions regarding the blockchain technology, and pointing out some worrisome practices in the field of blockchain technology. We first provide a brief introduction of the blockchain technology, highlighting its design principle, nuts and bolts, and the most fundamental innovation of the technology. Next, we elaborate on a key concept regarding data immutability. In particular, it is a mistake to equate blockchain to data immutability. Data immutability can only be achieved in large-scale public blockchains where the cost becomes an insurmountable barrier for any attempt to change the data recorded in the blockchain. The third topic we discuss is the differences between public, private, and consortium blockchains. We caution the use of private and consortium blockchains. The last topic we argue is regarding blockchain consensus. Because the proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm has obvious drawbacks on energy consumption, many alternative algorithms have been proposed. We single out two most egregious wrong practices: (1) selecting a small set of validators for reaching consensus, and (2) adopting traditional distributed consensus.},
