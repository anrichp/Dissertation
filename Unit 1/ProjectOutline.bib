  abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to the current state of art of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies. Blockchain is a fast-disruptive technology becoming a key instrument in share economy. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract aim to automatically and securely execute the needed responsibilities of a contract without the support of a centralized execution authority. The Smart Contract runs on top of the Blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between un-trusted parties without the interfere of third party to trust it as this Smart Contract is an executable code that runs with rules on the Blockchain. Smart Contracts have some features that serve the goals of social justice and fairness. The paper presents the basic important information about the structures of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies and conduct a comparison between the different methodologies used in the Smart Contracts. The issues faced within the Smart Contract technology are surveyed. The four key issues are identified as: codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. We survey case cases of usage of the Blockchain in various business sectors like real estate, voting system and supply chain. The paper aims to assist a developer to grasp the big picture of the Blockchain technology and to further assist in the decision process of suitability of the technology to a specific application area.},

One major difference are the performance and scalability factors which will be discussed and analytically investigated in this paper. In doing so, we provide guidance for defining a research agenda focusing on the investigation of the crucial role of scalability for blockchain systems. System performance -- measured in terms of (1) consensus response time (blockchain network latency or time to convergence/agreement); (2) number of transactions per second or throughput, and (3) computing (and power) resources consumed -- can be understood by considering the design dimensions of a blockchain system, namely: (i) the type of blockchain system needed from a requirements perspective which in turn determines; (ii) the complexity of the consensus protocol used; (iii) the topography of the traffic flow on the network; (iv) the performance and complexity of the domain-specific language that implements smart contracts; and (v) by the anticipated growth in size and complexity of the distributed ledger itself.},

  abstract = {With the increasing adoption of private blockchain platforms, consortia operating in various sectors such as trade, finance, logistics, etc., are becoming common. Despite having the benefits of a completely decentralized architecture which supports transparency and distributed control, existing private blockchains limit the data, assets, and processes within its closed boundary, which restricts secure and verifiable service provisioning to the end-consumers. Thus, platforms such as e-commerce with multiple sellers or cloud federation with a collection of cloud service providers cannot be decentralized with the existing blockchain platforms. This paper proposes a decentralized gateway architecture interfacing private blockchain with end-users by leveraging the unique combination of public and private blockchain platforms through interoperation. Through the use case of decentralized cloud federations, we have demonstrated the viability of the solution. Our testbed implementation with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, with three service providers, shows that such consortium can operate within an acceptable response latency while scaling up to 64 parallel requests per second for cloud infrastructure provisioning. Further analysis over the Mininet emulation platform indicates that the platform can scale well with minimal impact over the latency as the number of participating service providers increases.},

Ideally the Internet infrastructure needs a distributed and tamper-resistant resource management framework which cannot be subverted by any single entity. A secure, distributed ledger enables such a mechanism and the blockchain is the best known example of distributed ledgers. In this paper, we propose the use of a blockchain based mechanism to secure the Internet BGP and DNS infrastructure. While the blockchain has scaling issues to be overcome, the key advantages of such an approach include the elimination of any PKI-like root of trust, a verifiable and distributed transaction history log, multi-signature based authorizations for enhanced security, easy extensibility and scriptable programmability to secure new types of Internet resources and potential for a built in cryptocurrency. A tamper resistant DNS infrastructure also ensures that it is not possible for the application level PKI to spoof HTTPS traffic.},

  abstract = {The slower than expected adoption rate of blockchain technology has highlighted that there are barriers due to the diversity of its applications and its users. To overcome this limitation and take full advantage of the novel technology, researchers from academia as well as industry are dedicated to find different solutions, where two or more blockchains can interact with each other. As a result, several interoperability solutions have presented themselves. To investigate the functionalities and underlying mechanisms of interoperable blockchain solutions, researchers have conducted several surveys by discussing the features and innovations of these methods. However, the existing surveys tend to focus on the architectural description of the interoperability solutions and completely overlook the most promising aspect of blockchain adaptability, namely the smart contract. This paper fills the gap by exploring the role of smart contracts in blockchain interoperability solutions. Our research has classified the existing interoperability solutions into three main categories: heterogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, homogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, heterogeneous blockchains, and heterogeneous smart contracts. To provide a systematic overview of the smart contracts used in blockchain interoperability, each category is further divided into subcategories by identifying the functionalities of the smart contract used. Based on our survey, a taxonomy is proposed to help classify the blockchain interoperability solutions. The interoperability solutions in each category are analyzed in-depth, and the results are presented in tabular format to illustrate the characteristics of the interoperability solutions in a meaningful way. Finally, a number of open issues and research directions are discussed to overcome the limitations and improve the performance of blockchain interoperability.},

However, interoperability between blockchains remains an open problem. Existing approaches provide integration through solutions using a middleware system, which makes it harder to gain confidence mainly in terms of security and correctness of the process. A cross-chain protocol needs to provide a self-verifiable state-proof that embeds trust in the transfer process. We propose a Burn-to-Claim cross-chain protocol to seamlessly exchange assets between networks. Our scheme transfers assets from one blockchain system to another in a way that the asset is burned from the source blockchain and claimed on the destination blockchain. Our mechanism employs combinations of crypto mechanisms such as digital signatures and time lock to operate the protocol in a distributed manner. We provide an analysis which proves that our cross-chain protocol transfers assets correctly and securely.},

  abstract = {Even though blockchain is mostly popular for its cryptocurrency, smart contracts have become a very prominent blockchain application. Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.},

  abstract = {Blockchain as a novel technology has shown the capacity to transform multiple sectors. Due to opportunities such as data security, transparency, privacy and interoperability presented by decentralized applications on blockchain networks, organizations are now moving their inter-organizational functions to blockchain-based systems. Traditional system-design methods are not suitable for developing blockchain systems since they are not capable of capturing new functions that are associated with decentralized applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring existing design methods and frameworks that support the development of decentralized application on a blockchain. To achieve this, case-study based research is used in identifying current software-development techniques used in designing decentralized applications (DApp). Experts in this field are interviewed to identify their chosen techniques for designing and developing block-chain applications. Furthermore, related literature is selected to identify current techniques for DApp-designs based on the state of the art. A systematic analysis of the identified techniques is conducted using the current limitations of blockchain technology as criteria for the analyses. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose a new model-driven framework for designing blockchain applications.},

  abstract = {Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of the Internet. However, the development of cross-blockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. With that regard, we propose an efficient, interoperable blockchain architecture, InterTrust, to support interoperability and trustworthiness among arbitrary blockchain systems (including homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains). It consists of an atomic cross-chain communication protocol, which can be considered an agnostic protocol to integrate existing blockchain systems smoothly. InterTrust is powered by two innovative techniques: threshold signature scheme and trusted hardware. The threshold signature scheme guarantees consistency and verifiability in the target blockchain systems, and the trusted hardware guarantees trusted services among distinct blockchain systems. Combining these two techniques provides an efficient cross-chain communication protocol to facilitate atomic swaps and interoperable operations between different blockchain systems. Our interoperable architecture is robust to support arbitrary blockchain systems. We also present the security analysis on the scenarios of integrating our protocol into Byzantine fault tolerance based blockchain systems.},

  abstract = {As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.},
