  abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to the current state of art of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies. Blockchain is a fast-disruptive technology becoming a key instrument in share economy. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract aim to automatically and securely execute the needed responsibilities of a contract without the support of a centralized execution authority. The Smart Contract runs on top of the Blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between un-trusted parties without the interfere of third party to trust it as this Smart Contract is an executable code that runs with rules on the Blockchain. Smart Contracts have some features that serve the goals of social justice and fairness. The paper presents the basic important information about the structures of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies and conduct a comparison between the different methodologies used in the Smart Contracts. The issues faced within the Smart Contract technology are surveyed. The four key issues are identified as: codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. We survey case cases of usage of the Blockchain in various business sectors like real estate, voting system and supply chain. The paper aims to assist a developer to grasp the big picture of the Blockchain technology and to further assist in the decision process of suitability of the technology to a specific application area.},

One major difference are the performance and scalability factors which will be discussed and analytically investigated in this paper. In doing so, we provide guidance for defining a research agenda focusing on the investigation of the crucial role of scalability for blockchain systems. System performance -- measured in terms of (1) consensus response time (blockchain network latency or time to convergence/agreement); (2) number of transactions per second or throughput, and (3) computing (and power) resources consumed -- can be understood by considering the design dimensions of a blockchain system, namely: (i) the type of blockchain system needed from a requirements perspective which in turn determines; (ii) the complexity of the consensus protocol used; (iii) the topography of the traffic flow on the network; (iv) the performance and complexity of the domain-specific language that implements smart contracts; and (v) by the anticipated growth in size and complexity of the distributed ledger itself.},

Challenges are currently holding back blockchain's enormous potential, such as scalability issues and frustrating trade-offs, most notably in public decentralized blockchain systems. In this paper, we conduct a Systematic Review of Literature in order to explore the current challenges of blockchains while presenting possible solutions to each of these challenges. We conclude that current challenges can be summarized in three categories: Scalability issues, security issues and a choice of the consensus protocol. We also briefly discuss the use of blockchain in current systems, concluding that while blockchains current immaturity makes it hard to recommend for most projects, blockchains in their current state could be used in the Internet of Things.},

  abstract = {Existing security mechanisms for managing the Internet infrastructural resources like IP addresses, AS numbers, BGP advertisements and DNS mappings rely on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that can be potentially compromised by state actors and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Ideally the Internet infrastructure needs a distributed and tamper-resistant resource management framework which cannot be subverted by any single entity. A secure, distributed ledger enables such a mechanism and the blockchain is the best known example of distributed ledgers. In this paper, we propose the use of a blockchain based mechanism to secure the Internet BGP and DNS infrastructure. While the blockchain has scaling issues to be overcome, the key advantages of such an approach include the elimination of any PKI-like root of trust, a verifiable and distributed transaction history log, multi-signature based authorizations for enhanced security, easy extensibility and scriptable programmability to secure new types of Internet resources and potential for a built in cryptocurrency. A tamper resistant DNS infrastructure also ensures that it is not possible for the application level PKI to spoof HTTPS traffic.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the development of social information and network leads to the explosive growth of data. The increasing amount and diversity of data have also encouraged researchers to make business decisions by analyzing the big data generated. This has also caused the rapid development of the data science industry. However, there are still many challenges to be solved, especially data security and privacy. Data security and privacy threat permeate every link of data science industry chain, such as data production, collection, processing and sharing, and the causes of risk are complex and interwoven. Blockchain technology is highly praised and recognized for its decentralized infrastructure, anonymity, security and other characteristics. It will change the way we access and share information. We believe that blockchain technology can overcome some limitations in data science and promote the development of data science, but it may also bring some other problems. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the relationship between blockchain technology and data science. In this paper, we investigate the researches and applications of blockchain technology in the field of data science and give the potential advantages and challenges that blockchain technology may bring to data science.},

Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.},

  abstract = {Blockchain as a novel technology has shown the capacity to transform multiple sectors. Due to opportunities such as data security, transparency, privacy and interoperability presented by decentralized applications on blockchain networks, organizations are now moving their inter-organizational functions to blockchain-based systems. Traditional system-design methods are not suitable for developing blockchain systems since they are not capable of capturing new functions that are associated with decentralized applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring existing design methods and frameworks that support the development of decentralized application on a blockchain. To achieve this, case-study based research is used in identifying current software-development techniques used in designing decentralized applications (DApp). Experts in this field are interviewed to identify their chosen techniques for designing and developing block-chain applications. Furthermore, related literature is selected to identify current techniques for DApp-designs based on the state of the art. A systematic analysis of the identified techniques is conducted using the current limitations of blockchain technology as criteria for the analyses. Finally, based on the findings of this study, we propose a new model-driven framework for designing blockchain applications.},

  abstract = {As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.},
