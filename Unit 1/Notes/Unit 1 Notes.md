## Key Elements of a Dissertation

### Research Question

This is the central question that I will be answering throughout the dissertation.
This sets the scene for the entire project.

### Aims and objectives

The project should have an aim and several supporting objectives.
The aim represents the goal of the dissertation and the objectives should support in delivering that goal.

### Project Plan

Due to the size of the project it would be useful to plan the project using a project management tool.

### Literature Review

It is essential to understand the existing research landscape.

### Implementation and Exprimentation

By the end of the dissertation, there will likely be a piece of software developed.

### Evaluation

Evaluating my own work for its strength and weaknesses is all part of critical thinking.

## Types of Research

During the dissertation, I will likely use both primary and secondary research where the literature review will be secondary, and the development of an application could be primary.

### Primary

Primary research will involve creating data, whether this is the output of an experiment, a piece of software or survey results.
One of the considerations when carrying out primary research is the need to obtain ethical approval.

### Secondary

This typically relies on secondary sources of data.
Includes an in-depth review of existing literature and critical analysis of existing data.

## Research Problem

Identify the gap in the knowledge that I want to explore in the dissertation.
What sort of research do I want to work on?

### Identify a topic area

Investigate areas that are overlooked or lack knowledge.
Once you have an area, read around the topic and consider who is affected by the problem, how long has the problem been around and, what has been done to date in the research.
After the context of the problem narrow the scope of the idea.

## Cars Model

### Counter-claiming

- Challenging earlier research.

### Indicating a gap

- Identify a gap in the research and highlight that previous research does not adequately address all of the questions or problems.

### Question rasing

- Ask questions about earlier work.

## Title of Dissertation

- Consider a working title.
- Clear and informative.
- Communicate what you are writing about.

## Aims and Objectives

- Must be smart

## Choosing a Dissertation Topic

### Identify a broad area of research

- Faculty support
  - best to work on a dissertation that has a shared interest
- Personal interest
  - You want to be interested in the topic.
  - You should not be invested in a scenario where you cant be objective.

### Review literature

- Identify topics in a broad.
- Scope will narrow once you find interesting areas.
- Focus on learning what has been done, what has not worked, what others have found and what is missing in the literature.
- Identify a gap in the field; this will be the basis of the problem you want to address.

### Research problems and questions

- Researching the gap in the literature will identify the problem to be addressed.
- Establish the research questions.

### Theoretical perspective

### Method

- Once you have decided on all of the elements then we can identify the method used.
