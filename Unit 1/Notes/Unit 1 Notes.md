## Key Elements of a Dissertation

### Research Question

This is the central question that I will be answering throughout the dissertation.
This sets the scene for the entire project.

### Aims and objectives

The project should have an aim and several supporting objectives.
The aim represents the goal of the dissertation and the objectives should support in delivering that goal.

### Project Plan

Due to the size of the project it would be useful to plan the project using a project management tool.

### Literature Review

It is important to understand the existing research landscape.

### Implementation and Exprimentation

By the end of the dissertation there will likely be a piece of software developed.

### Evaluation

Evaluating my own work for it's strngsth and weaknesses is all part of critical thinking.

## Types of Research

Durinig the dissertation I will likely use both primary and secondary research where the literature review will be in the form of secondary and the development of an application could be pirmary.

### Primary

Primary research will involve creating data, whether this is the output of an experiment, a piece of software or survey results.
One of the considerations when carrying out primary research is the need to obtain ethical approval.

### Secondary

This typically relies on secondary sources of data.
Includes an in-depth review of existing literature and critical analysis of existing data.
