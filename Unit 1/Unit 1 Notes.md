## Key Elements of a Dissertation

### Research Question

This is the central question that I will be answering throughout the dissertation.
This sets the scene for the entire project.

### Aims and objectives

The project should have an aim and several supporting objectives.
The aim represents the goal of the dissertation and the objectives should support in delivering that goal.

### Project Plan

Due to the size of the project it would be useful to plan the project using a project management tool.

### Literature Review

It is important to understand the existing research landscape.

### Implementation and Exprimentation

By the end of the dissertation there will likely be a piece of software developed.

### Evaluation

Evaluating my own work for it's strngsth and weaknesses is all part of critical thinking.
