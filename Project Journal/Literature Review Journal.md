## Exercise 1.1

### Discovering the Subject of Your Interest or Issue of Concern

1. What is your personal interest or issue?
   1. I am interested in blockchain technology as a whole; when blockchain conversations began on forums early on, I was always intrigued by how the community bought into the concepts. 
   2. Initially, I was drawn to mining bitcoin as a means of contributing a node to the network and earning bitcoin due to the mining process.
   3. Looking back at my prior experience with bitcoin, I am pretty interested in the concept of proof of work and how that provides security to blockchain transactions.
2. What are the component parts of this interest?
   1. Blockchain technology
   2. Blockchain mining
   3. Proof of work
3. Why did you become curious about this question?
   1. I have always been interested in technologies that have created some form of disruption to legacy systems and ideas. Seeing the rise of blockchain technology has been incredible to witness. We have seen scepticism followed by mass adoption of these technologies even by baking organisations.

## Exercise 1.2

### Understanding the Personal Viewpoint

1. What previous knowledge do you have about your interest?
   1. I have experience operating a blockchain node and interacting with the bitcoin core application; further, than that, I have no experience with blockchain development or some of the advanced mechanics of blockchain technology.
   2. As I am completing this literature review activity after I have performed my literature search, I do have some exposure to how nodes work within a blockchain and how to establish permissioned networks on a blockchain.
   3. When exploring gaps in the knowledge in blockchain technology, I have come across blockchain interoperability of blockchains, which is an area of research and development focusing on how blockchains will interoperate with one another to facilitate cross-chain interoperability. Frameworks like Polkadot have facilitated such advancements; however, very few active projects provide an overview of how this would work in practice.
2. What personal experience do you have that influences you about this issue or interest?
   1. As previously mentioned, I have experience with mining in the past, and as an early adopter of this technology, I do have a particular affinity to bitcoin as it was the first publically successful blockchain.
3. What are your beliefs, biases, and opinions about this interest or issue?

   - I believe that blockchain technology represents another problem all in its own, and that is trust. We have trusted traditional organisations to act in our best interest, and this has proven not to be the case over time. Blockchain technology facilitates a pre-defined trust that will negate the need to involve humans in the trust mechanism of financial management. We will have full control of our finances and resources in a decentralised way that will destabilise existing industries.

4. What predisposes you to certain conclusions about the issue or concern of study?

   - I believe that governments and banking organisations have fundamentally failed society and that the web 3.0 revolution will destabilise these organisations.

5. How will you identify and isolate your personal bias, opinion, feelings, and intuition to preserve a neutral position as a researcher?

   - I will apply critical thinking and reflection to weigh up my personal bias so that I am not contributing my bias and beliefs to the body of work. I will evaluate all the available resources and be open-minded to changing my opinion and understanding of the topic.

## Exercise 1.3

### Generalised statement

How can blockchain technology facilitate data interoperability in a banking organisation?

### Limiting the Interest of Your Study

1. Clearly identify the subject of the study of interest.
   - The subject of the study my study of interest is blockchain technology.
2. Are you looking at individuals, groups, or organisations?
   - organisations
3. Specifically, name the individuals, groups, or organisations that you plan to study.
   - Banking organisations
   - Marketing teams within banking organisations
   - Finance teams within banking organisations

## Exercise 1.4

1. What academic fields best lend themselves to your subject and perspective for research?
   - Computer Science
   - Mathematics
   - Cryptography
2. What are the specific knowledge areas of this academic field that will best help in exploring and defining the research subject?
   - Blockchain Frameworks
   - Blockchain interoperability
   - Organisational interoperability
   - Cryptography
3. What knowledge competency do you have in this academic field?
   - I have a general awareness of blockchain technology and have a good understanding of the mechanics that facilitate blockchain transactions. However, I have yet to explore organisational interoperability and blockchain frameworks.
4. What additional knowledge of this academic field do you need to acquire to have a solid foundation to address this interest?
   - Blockchain frameworks
   - Organisational interoperability
   - Permissioned blockchain networks
   - blockchain technology

## Exercise 1.5

1. What is your specific personal interest?
   1. The interest, issue, or concern of my research is to explore whether blockchain technology can facilitate a working application for a banking organisation that facilitates organisational interoperability by providing decentralised storage of customer records that is accessible throughout the organisation and kept up to date as changes are made across the organisation. Furthermore, departments within the organisation should have access to the blockchain as an authenticated node on a permissioned network which is different from a publically accessible blockchain network.
   2. Cross out the least important sentences without changing the key idea.
      - blockchain technology working application for a banking organisation that facilitates organisational interoperability customer records that is accessible throughout the organisation and kept up to date departments within the organisation should have access to the blockchain as an authenticated node on a permissioned network
   3. Cross out any words or phrases that can be removed without changing the meaning.
      - A permissioned banking blockchain facilitating organisational interoperability of customer records allowing departments to assess and update data in real-time.
   4. Reduce your remaining draft to three sentences.
      - A permissioned banking blockchain facilitating organisational interoperability of customer records allowing departments to assess and update data in real-time.
   5. Be sure your final three sentences identify the subject, perspective, and vantage point.
      - I believe that the sentence above meets these criteria.
2. What contributions to the field make this research important?
   - From initial reading to identify the topic, I have found very little research into the uses of blockchain technology to store user profiles within a bank. There are a few examples within the health sector; however very little outside of that realm.
3. What are your beliefs, values, biases, and opinions about this interest?
   1. How will these beliefs, values, biases, and opinions help you in conducting your research?
      - I am passionate about blockchain technology and its transparency in several use cases. I believe that the technology will ultimately replace the need for human trust as all trust will be based upon consensus reached within the code.
   2. How will you prevent the beliefs and biases contained in your personal viewpoint from affecting the necessary neutral stance of a researcher?
      - By applying critical thinking and absorbing a collection of different view points that challenge my biases.
