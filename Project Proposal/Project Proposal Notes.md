# Project Proposal Notes

- Subject area. What is the topic and the scope of your project?
- Aim. what is the goal of your project?
- Arguments. Why is is important to investigate the chosen topic?
- Objectives. Preliminary idea for how you intent to achieve the aim.

## Chossing a Subject Area

- Have you previously encountered subject areas or course that you felt wre especiall intersting?
- Would like to work within a particular subject are in the future.

### Choose Problem to Focus on Within the Subject Area

- Focus your interest by identifying a problem with the subject area that you would like to explore.
- Ask yourself what you would like to do within a particular area given your existing knowledge.
- Read the literature and determine whether someone else has not planned to do what you are planning to do.
- Ask supervisors what would be good ideas for a proposal.
- Try avoid a subject that you have little to no experience in as you would need to spend valuable time reading about the basics of that topic.
- Write down why you think it is important to investigate the problem.

#### What type of project do I want to do?

- A descriptive project
  - Present the state of the art for a given project.
  - Two types:
    - 1. Categorise and compare previous work within the subject area.
      - Categorise previous work
      - Selecting comparison criteria
      - Comparing previous work with respct to the comparison criteria
    - 2. Gain an understanding of the current status of the subject.
      - Selecting questions
      - Interviewing people
      - Identifiying important factors from interviews
- A theory oriented project
  - Compare existing theoretical models without testing them in practice.
  - Two Types:
    - 1. The aim is to exten an already existing theory or model.
      - Identify the deatils of the extensions (e.g. what types of business rules)
      - Introducing the extension to the original theoretical model
      - Comparing the original theoretical model with the extended version
    - 2. Compare the support for business rules in two different data models.
      - Selecting comparison criteria
      - Analyse the two data models with repsect to the comparison criteria
- An applied project
  - Deal with conducting experiments and building proof-of principle implementations, and gather experiences from them.
    - 1. Gain experince from implementing an algorithm for caching of web data
      - Setting up simulator
      - Implementing the new algorithm
      - Testing and analysing the results obtained
      - Suggesting improvements to the algorithm
- A comparison of theory and practice
  - Project which combine theory and practice may contrast the theory with current practice in companies or organisations.
    - 1. Contrast the current theory relating to object-oriented modelling, with how companies and organisations use obhect-oriented modelling in pracice.
      - Selecting companies and organisations
      - Selecting comparison criteria
      - Investigating the details of the theory with repect to the comparison criteira
      - Investigating how companies or organisations work with object-oriented modelling with respect to the comparison criteria
      - Comparion of the results obtained.
