# Research Methods Notes

## What method

The more I am looking at the interoperability of a blockchain with centralised systems, I will need to look into developing my own Polkadot parachain that could potentially connect a centralised system to a blockchain of blockchain networks. The biggest question here is if I have the time to develop this system.

## What is research?

- A diligent and systematic inquiry or investigation in an area, with the objective of discovering or revising facts, theories, applications etc.
- The goal is to discover and disseminate new knowledge.
- Should be a unique contribution to knowledge to mankind.
- In a scientific research project, the primary objective is to learn and understand complex phenomena.
- A systematic problem-solving activity undertaken with care and concern in the context of the situation.
- Research projects normally start with a basic research question that you want to study. The question should be central to the project, thus helping to maintain the focus on the project's purpose.

## Research methods

Once you have a specific question suitable for study in a project, the next step is to choose an appropriate, systematic method.

- Genreally speaking, a moethod represents the means, procedure or technique used to carry out some process in a logical, orderly, and systematic way.
- Organised approach
  - 1. Collecting data.
  - 2. Formulating a hypothesis.
  - 3. Testing the hypothesis.
  - 4. Interpreting the results.
  - 5. Stating conclusions.

### Quantitative Research Methods

- Undertand how something is constructed.
- Research is driven by hypotheses, which are formulated and tested.
- The goal is to disprove the hypotheses.
- Develop models, theories, and hypotheses pertaining to natural phenomena.
- The quantitative aspect is emphasise that measurement is fundemental since it gives connection between observation and the formalisation of the model, theory and hypothesis.

### Qualitative Research Methods

- Origin in social sciences.
- Concerned with increasing out understanding of an area, rather than producing an explanation for it. 
- A problem is studied in a unique setting and identifying problems in organisations. 
- Repeatability is no always possible.
