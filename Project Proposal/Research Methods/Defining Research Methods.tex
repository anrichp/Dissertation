\section{Methodology}

Action Research and Experimental Research.

\subsubsection{Overview of Approach}

For my dissertation project, I anticipate that I will use a combination of both action research and experimental research methods.
\autocite{dawsonChapterResearchMethods2015} state that action research involves defining a specific problem, then working towards a solution along with a subject or organisation.
Furthermore, \autocite{blairChapterChoosingMethodology2016} states that action research is considered a methodology or an approach to "find solutions to practical problems."
In addition to action research, the author highlights that development projects typically fall under the experiment method, where the researcher investigates the "causal relationships using tests controlled by yourself."
